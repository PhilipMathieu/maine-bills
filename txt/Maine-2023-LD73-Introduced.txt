7 have the following meanings.
8 1. Bottler. "Bottler" means a person that extracts water in this State to be sold as 
9 bottled water.
10 2. Community water system. "Community water system" has the same meaning as 
11 in section 2660-B, subsection 2.
12 3. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. "Perfluoroalkyl and 
13 polyfluoroalkyl substances" or "PFAS" means a perfluoroalkyl substance or 
14 polyfluoroalkyl substance that is detectable in drinking water using standard laboratory 
15 methods established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, including 
16 regulated PFAS contaminants.
17 4. Regulated PFAS contaminants. "Regulated PFAS contaminants" means 
18 perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, 
19 perfluorononanoic acid and perfluoroheptanoic acid.
20 ยง2660-BB. Bottled water monitoring, testing and treatment requirements
21 A bottler shall comply with the provisions of this section.
22 1. Initial monitoring. A bottler shall conduct initial monitoring for the level of PFAS 
23 applicable to a community water system detectable using standard laboratory methods 
24 established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in effect at the time of 
25 sampling. A bottler shall conduct monitoring under this subsection for all regulated PFAS 
26 contaminants and additional PFAS included in the list of analytes in the standard laboratory 
27 methods established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency applicable to 
28 community water systems in effect at the time of sampling.
29 2. Subsequent monitoring. After completion of initial monitoring under subsection 
30 1, a bottler shall conduct continued monitoring for the presence of regulated PFAS 
31 contaminants in water bottled by the bottler according to this subsection.
32 A. If initial monitoring under subsection 1 detects the presence of any regulated PFAS 
33 contaminants individually or in combination at or above the standard applicable to a 
34 community water system, the bottler shall conduct continued quarterly monitoring until 
35 regulated PFAS contaminants are mitigated as described in subsection 4.
36 B. If initial monitoring under subsection 1 detects the presence of any regulated PFAS 
37 contaminants at or above each analyte's lowest concentration minimum reporting level 
38 as specified in the standard laboratory methods established by the United States 
39 Environmental Protection Agency applicable to community water systems in effect at
