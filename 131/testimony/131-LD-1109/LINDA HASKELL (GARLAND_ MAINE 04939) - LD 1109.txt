Maine to Create Consistent Election Date for Citizen-initiated Referenda in 
Even-numbered Election Years
Testimony LINDA P HASKELL OPPOSE THIS LD1109 RESOLUTION
 THE 28TH LINE HAS WORDING CHANGED FROM  year "in" which petition is 
filed to  -- "after". I do not agree with this. This wording change would make a  
disastrous change in the procedure. I oppose this.
