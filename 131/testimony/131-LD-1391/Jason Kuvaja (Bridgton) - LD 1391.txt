LD 1391
I would Like to add to my previous testimony in opposition of LD 1391.
This bill does nothing to the source of the over supply problems. This source is illicit 
product flooding in from out of state farms, like in California. This bill would in fact 
make this problem much worse by limiting legal grows, but ignoring the illicit mail 
market.
Thank you.
