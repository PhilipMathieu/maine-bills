 TO:  The Honorable Tim Nangle  The Honorable Holly Stover, Co-Chairs  Members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government  DATE:  May 22, 2023  RE:  Supplemental Information on LD 1885 -  RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment  to the Constitution of Maine to Simplify Legislative Redistricting  Testimony presented in support of LD 1885 describes more equitable experiences for constituents,  increased opportunities for House and Senate candidates to coordinate campaigns and increased  opportunities for Representatives and Senators to coordinate constituent meetings and town halls.  In  addition, nesting a whole number of House Districts within each Senate District can reduce the number  of ballot styles.  During the public hearing on LD 1885, members of the committee raised questions that we hope to  address below.  Why address this issue now?  With the next redistricting cycle several years off, the current Legislature  has an opportunity to focus on the statewide effects of nested districts, rather than a detailed analysis of  how specific municipalities and seats might fare.  This dynamic becomes more complex as the next  redistricting cycle approaches.  Why reduce the size of the Senate?  Are there other options?  Given that the current Senate/House  ratio does not permit the redistricting commission to apply nested districts statewide, the size of one or  both chambers would need to be adjusted for Maine to realize the benefits of nested districts.  In LD  1885, we focused on providing the redistricting commission with the option to nest districts with no net  change to the total number of legislators.  In the following table, option 2 is the status quo, with a  Senate/House ratio of 4.3.   LD 1885 is intended to enable (but not require) Option 3 which allows for  nested districts with no change in the total number of legislators.  Options 1, 4 and 5 allow for nested  districts, but require a more significant modification to the size of the House.  PO Box 863  Augusta, ME 04332  lwvme@gwi.net  207.622.0256  www.lwvme.org

Under the heading “Reduce the Size of the  Legislature” there are several proposals which specify a 33-seat Senate coupled with either a 99 or  132-seat House, debated in the context of the 1969 constitutional amendment setting the size of the  Senate at “not less than 31 nor more than 35.”  Might this proposal affect urban and rural areas in different ways?  The redistricting process itself does  affect urban and rural communities in different ways, but the proposed amendment seems unlikely to  affect the situation in a material way.  Large, urban areas are split into multiple House Districts, with any  remainder forming part of another district.  Smaller municipalities in more rural areas are generally  merged into a House District composed of several intact municipalities. The exact number of split  municipalities, and which municipalities are affected might well change, due either to relative population  growth or a change in the number of Senate Districts, but a qualitative change for either urban or rural  municipalities would appear unlikely.  Could we instead establish a 32-seat Senate, with two seats per county?  As written, LD 1885 modifies  only the constitutional language related to the size of the House.  The legislation could certainly be  amended to adjust the size of the Senate, but the 1964 SCOTUS ruling in  Reynolds v Sim  s  prevents  apportioning Senate seats by county:  “The seats in both houses of a bicameral legislature must, under  the Equal Protection Clause, be apportioned substantially on a population basis.”.  Thank you for the opportunity to present this additional information for the committee’s consideration.
