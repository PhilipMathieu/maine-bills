Correctional ::ind Judicial Impact Statements 
Establishes new class B, C and D crimes for violations of the Maine Money Transmission Modernization Act. It is 
unclear how many additional individuals will be convicted of a Class B or C crime who otherwise would not have 
been. The current average cost of incarcerating one individual for a single year is $55,203. No funding has been 
included in the bill at this time. 
This bill may increase the number of cases filed in the court system. The additional workload associated with the 
minimal number of new cases does not require additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional filing fees will increase General Fund Revenue by minor amounts and the collection of 
additional fines will increase General Fund or other dedicated revenue by minor amounts.
