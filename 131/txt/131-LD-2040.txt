1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law does not allow the Board of Dental Practice to issue letters of 
4 guidance in matters not relating to complaints filed against licensees; and
5Whereas, the board uses letters of guidance primarily to educate licensees in matters 
6 involving licensure applications and supervision responsibilities without filing formal 
7 complaints; and
8Whereas, the board has many cases aging on its docket and requiring a formal 
9 complaint to be filed to resolve any matter necessitating a letter of guidance would reduce 
10 the efficiency of the board, take up more board staff time and prevent the board from 
11 addressing other matters; and
12Whereas, the elimination of the board's authority in this regard was an error; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §18325, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
193.  Letters of guidance.  In addition to the authority conferred under Title 10, section 
20 8003, subsection 5-A, the board may issue a letter of guidance or concern to a licensee or 
21 registrant.  A letter of guidance or concern may be used to educate, reinforce knowledge 
22 regarding legal or professional obligations and express concern over action or inaction by 
23 the licensee or registrant that does not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to merit 
24 disciplinary action.  The issuance of a letter of guidance or concern is not a formal 
25 proceeding and does not constitute an adverse disciplinary action of any form.  
26 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a letter of guidance or concern is not 
27 confidential.  The board may place a letter of guidance or concern, together with any 
28 underlying complaint, report and investigation materials, in a licensee's or registrant's file 
29 for a specified amount of time, not to exceed 10 years.  Any letters, complaints and 
30 materials placed on file may be accessed and considered by the board in any subsequent 
31 action commenced against the licensee or registrant within the specified time frame.  
32 Complaints, reports and investigation materials placed on file are only confidential to the 
33 extent that confidentiality is required pursuant to Title 24, chapter 21.
34Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
35 takes effect when approved.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill restores authority to the Board of Dental Practice to issue letters of guidance 
38 involving matters other than a dismissal of a complaint against a licensee.
