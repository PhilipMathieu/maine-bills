SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. It updates the laws regarding 
high-stakes beano to allow federally recognized Indian tribes that are licensed to operate 
high-stakes beano to be issued up to 2 licenses, instead of just one as in current law. It also 
removes ce1iain restrictions regarding when and where high-stakes beano can be conducted 
based on which federally recognized Indian tribe is operating high-stakes beano and instead 
authorizes any federally recognized Indian tribe licensed to operate high-stakes beano to 
do so up to 200 days per year and allows federally recognized Indian tribes to operate high­
stakes beano on their territory or trust land or at a location in a municipality that is adjacent 
to that federally recognized Indian tribe's territory or trust land as approved by that 
municipality. It also makes other technical corrections to the high-stakes beano law. 
The amendment also authorizes the Depatiment of Public Safety, Gambling Control 
Unit to issue licenses to operate electronic lucky seven devices to eligible organizations 
and to federally recognized Indian tribes. The amendment provides restrictions on the 
number, location and operation of electronic lucky seven devices and requires licensees to 
operate at least one kiosk for the redemption of electronic lucky seven vouchers. It also

This bill makes changes to the rules regarding high-stakes beano licensing. It adds authorization to the charitable 
gaming laws allowing the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of Public Safety to issue licenses to 
operate electronic lucky seven devices to eligible organizations and to federally recognized Indian tribes and to collect 
1 % of the gross revenue from licensees. 
License and application fees are estimated to generate $274,600 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue starting in 
fiscal year 2024-25. This assumes 315 eligible organizations will seek to acquire electronic lucky seven devices, 
dispensers, and sealed ticket registrations. The GCU estimates that gross revenue collected will generate $70,000 in 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue starting in fiscal year 2024-25. 
This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $774,422 to the GCU beginning in fiscal year 2024-25 for 
one Public Service Coordinator position, 2 Auditor II positions, 4 Public Safety Inspector I positions and associated 
costs. The bill also includes ongoing Other Special Revenue Fund allocations of $76,112 to the GCU beginning in 
fiscal year 2024-25 for costs associated with these positions.
