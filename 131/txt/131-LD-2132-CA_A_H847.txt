. This bill may increase the number of appeals to the Law Court. The additional workload does not require additional
funding at this time.
The collection of additional filing fees will increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts,
Fiscal Detail and Notes
The Public Utilities Commission has indicated that the additional adjudicatory proceedings due to this bill will require
additional staff and resources to implement. This bill includes ongoing allocations of $540,237 to the PUC starting in
fiscal year 2024-25 for two Staff Attorney positions and two Utility Analyst positions and associated costs. Since the
PUC is funded by assessments on impacted utilities set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures needed to
operate it, the increased allocations in this bill require a corresponding increase in revenue from those assessments.
