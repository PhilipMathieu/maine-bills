1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, it is necessary to make changes to the property tax assessment laws in order 
4 for those changes to take effect before the assessment and reassessment of property by the 
5 April 1st statutory date on which the taxable value of property is based; and
6Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
9 therefore,
10Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
