3SUMMARY
4 This bill amends the labor relations laws governing state employees, judicial 
5 employees and university, academy and community college employees. In current law, 
6 when such employees in a collective bargaining unit file a request with their public 
7 employer to be represented by a certain organization as their collective bargaining agent, 
8 the public employer is authorized to request an election from the Maine Labor Relations 
9 Board in order to determine whether the organization indeed represents a majority of the 
10 members in the collective bargaining unit. As in the laws governing municipal employees, 
11 the bill requires an election in such cases only if, after examining the demonstration of 
12 majority support, the Maine Labor Relations Board finds majority support for the 
13 organization to be in question.1
