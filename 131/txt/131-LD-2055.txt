1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently implementing 
4 electronic visit verification for hospice providers within the MaineCare program, which is 
5 not required under the federal 21st Century Cures Act; and
6Whereas, many hospice providers are unable to comply with electronic visit 
7 verification; and
8Whereas, expanding electronic visit verification to hospice providers increases the 
9 administrative burden without consideration for the increased financial cost, with no 
10 material impact on fraud prevention or improvement in care for MaineCare members; and
11Whereas, it is important that the Department of Health and Human Services cease 
12 implementing electronic visit verification as soon as possible because residents of the State 
13 and their families depend on hospice services for end-of-life care; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
18Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
19Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3174-NNN is enacted to read:
20§3174-NNN.  MaineCare hospice electronic visit verification prohibited
21 The department may not implement electronic visit verification for providers offering 
22 hospice services under the MaineCare program until electronic visit verification is 
23 mandated for these services by the Federal Government.
24 For purposes of this section, "electronic visit verification" means a system under which 
25 visits conducted as part of hospice services are electronically verified with respect to the 
26 type of service performed, the individual receiving the service, the date of the service, the 
27 location of service delivery, the individual providing the service and the time the service 
28 begins and ends.
29Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
30 takes effect when approved.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing 
33 electronic visit verification for providers offering hospice services within the MaineCare 
34 program until electronic visit verification is mandated for those services by the Federal 
35 Government.
