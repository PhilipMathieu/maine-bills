1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §344, sub-§1, as amended by PL 1991, c. 804, Pt. B, §2 and 
3 affected by §7, is further amended to read:
41.  Acceptance and notification.  The commissioner shall notify the applicant in 
5 writing of the official date on which the application was accepted as complete for 
6 processing or the reasons the application was not accepted.  If a written notice of acceptance 
7 or nonacceptance is not mailed to the applicant within 15 working days of receipt of the 
8 application, the application is deemed to be accepted as complete for processing on the 
9 15th working day after receipt by the department.  If the application is not accepted, the 
10 commissioner shall return the application to the applicant with the reasons for 
11 nonacceptance specified in writing.  A reason for nonacceptance of an application may 
12 include, but is not limited to, submission of the application after the activity requiring a 
13 permit or license pursuant to this Title has begun if the applicant knowingly violated a 
14 requirement to obtain the permit or license for the activity or the applicant previously 
15 violated a requirement to obtain a permit or license pursuant to this Title.  Any applicant 
16 whose application has not been accepted by the commissioner shall attend a presubmission 
17 meeting with the department before resubmitting that application.  The commissioner shall 
18 notify the board of all applications accepted as complete.
19 An application is acceptable as complete for processing if the application is properly filled 
20 out and information is provided for each of the items included on the form.  Acceptance of 
21 an application as complete for review does not constitute a determination by the department 
22 on the sufficiency of that information and does not preclude the department from requesting 
23 additional information during processing.
24 The commissioner shall require the applicant to provide notice to the public for each 
25 application for a permit or license accepted.  The commissioner shall solicit comments from 
26 the public for each application in a manner prescribed by the board in the rules.
27 All correspondence notifying an applicant of denial of an application by the board or 
28 commissioner must be by certified mail, return receipt requested.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill provides that the Department of Environmental Protection may specify as a 
31 reason for nonacceptance of a permit or license application that the application was 
32 submitted after the activity requiring the permit or license has begun if the applicant 
33 knowingly violated a requirement to obtain a permit or license for the activity or the 
34 applicant previously violated a requirement to obtain a permit or license.
