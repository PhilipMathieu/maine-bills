HOUSE AMENDMENT "M" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1240, L.D.1932
SUMMARY
This amendment removes the requirement in Committee Amendment "A" that a
provider notify a customer of the reason for an inten-uption of broadband Internet access
service if the service is interrupted for 6 or more consecutive hours in a single monthly
billing period and, if the intermption in service is not caused by an. act beyond the
reasonable control of the provider, provide the customer with a pro rata credit or rebate
during the billing period following the intermption. Instead, the amendment requires a
customer seeking a pro rata credit or rebate for interruption in service to submit a request
to the provider no later than 60 days after the end of the billing period in which the
interruption occurred. Finally, the amendment specifies fhat a customer is not eligible for
a pro rata credit or rebate for ip.terruption in service if the interruption in service was caused
by an act beyond the reasoi^ble control offhejMoyider,
