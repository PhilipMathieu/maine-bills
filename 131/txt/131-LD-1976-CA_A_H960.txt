resubmitted in its entirety for state review under the department's most current review 
standards. 
If the department finds that a plan is not consistent with the procedures, goals. requirements 
and guidelines established in this subchapter, the municipality or multimunicipal 4istriet 
region that submitted the plan may appeal that finding to the department within 20 business 
days of receipt of the finding in accordance with rules adopted by the department, which 
are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
The department's decision on consistency of a comprehensive plan constitutes final agency 
action. 
A finding by the department pursuant to paragraph P D-1 that a comprehensive plan is 
consistent with the procedures, goals. requirements and guidelines established in this 
subchapter is valid for 12 years from the date of its issuance. A finding by the former State 
Planning Office issued pursuant to this subchapter prior to December 31, 2000 that a 
comprehensive plan is consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in 
this subchapter is valid until December 31, 2012. For purposes of section 4314, subsection 
3 and section 4352, subsection 2, expiration of a finding of consistency pursuant to this 
subsection does not itself make a comprehensive plan inconsistent with the procedures, 
goals, requirements and guidelines established in this subchapter. 
4. Updates and amendments. A municipality or multimunicipal region may submit 
proposed amendments to a comprehensive plan or growth management program to the 
department for review in the same manner as provided for the review of new plans and 
programs. Subsequent to voluntary certification under this subsection, the municipality or 
multimunicipal region shall file a copy of an amendment to a growth management program 
with the department within 3 0 days after adopting the amendment and at least 60 days prior 
to applying for any state grant program that offers a preference for consistency or 
certification. 
5. Regional councils. Subject to the availability of funding and pursuant to the 
conditions of a contract, each regional council shall review and submit written comments 
on the comprehensive plan or growth management program of any municipality or 
multimunicipal region within its planning region. The comments must be submitted to the 
department and contain an analysis of: 
A. Whether the comprehensive plan or growth management program is compatible 
with identified regional policies and needs; and 
B. Whether the comprehensive plan or growth management program is compatible 
with plans or programs of municipalities or multimunicipal regions that may be 
affected by the proposal.

Sec. 18. 30-A MRSA §5953-D, sub-§4-A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 288, §3, is 
further amended to read: 
4-A. Criteria; conditions for downtown improvement grants or loans, The 
Department of Economic and Community Development, in conjunction with the bank, 
shall develop criteria and conditions for the award of downtown improvement grants or 
loans to eligible municipalities after consultation with the state agencies listed in subsection 
5 and subject to the requirements of this section. The department shall establish a 
preference for municipalities that are regional service centers or urban compact 
municipalities or have adopted a comprehensive plan consistent with section~ 4326-A. 
Sec. 19. Department to adopt rules. The Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use Planning shall 
amend existing rules governing the growth management program to be consistent with the 
laws governing the program as amended by this Act. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 30-A, section 4312, subsection 4, rules adopted pursuant to this section are 
major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. The following 
placetype descriptions must be incorporated into the rules. 
1, Adjacent neighborhood, "Adjacent neighborhood" means a primarily residential 
area located adjacent to a village center, downtown or high-impact corridor. Adjacent 
neighborhoods are predominantly developed for residential activities and are typically 
arranged along a network of interconnected streets. 
Page 17 - 131LR1377(02) 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
ROS 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A' to H.P. 1267, L.D. 1976 
1 2. Adjacent rural lands. "Adjacent rural lands" means large undeveloped land areas 
2 adjacent to rural backlands and to areas where there is development activity. Adjacent rural 
3 lands typically include land located behind lots along rural roads or adjacent to a rural 
4 center, village or other placetype. Adjacent rural lands can also be located adjacent to 
5 suburban areas. Because of proximity to land where development is present, adjacent rural 
6 lands are a high priority for local planning and policy work to verify goals for future land 
7 use. 
8 3. Advanced suburban area. "Advanced suburban area" means an area where low-
9 density development has spread from the road :frontage deeper into lots and to adjacent 
10 rural land. Development within these areas is typically segregated by use and may include 
11 commercial strip malls, regional shopping centers, so-called big box retail development, 
12 office parks, residential subdivisions and other forms of single-use development. 
13 Advanced suburban areas result in disconnected development and :fragmented open spaces 
14 disconnected from a larger network of habitat corridors, trails and other natural systems. 
15 4. Rural backlands. "Rural backlands
11 
means geographically isolated areas with no 
16 direct frontage onto public roads. Rural backlands often have very little or no development 
17 and may be intersected by trails and utility corridors. These areas may contain conserved 
18 lands, critical natural resources and important natural resources. Depending on local 
19 municipal land use policies, rural backlands may be targeted for conservation, as working 
20 lands, or for development that limits impacts on wildlife, water management, agricultural 
21 uses and active outdoor recreation activities. 
22 5. Rural center. "Rural center" means an area with a grouping of2 or more buildings 
23 that have formed a center of community within a rural area. It may include historic or 
24 architecturally important or significant buildings. A rural center can vary in size but is 
25 geographically smaller in size than a village placetype. 
26 6. Rural farmstead. "Rural farmstead" means a parcel of land that serves or has the 
27 potential to serve as a mixed-use, resource-based economic center of activity in a rural area. 
28 A rural farmstead may consist of adjacent buildings on a single parcel that support the 
29 commercial, residential and economic needs of a rural agricultural or forestry business. A 
30 rural farmstead allows for mixed-use development in rural areas to provide economic 
31 options to rural landowners while also safeguarding the agricultural and forest sectors from 
32 fragmented low-density development. 
33 7. Rural road. "Rural road" means a road that has the characteristics of a rural area, 
34 with homes and businesses occurring at infrequent intervals on lots that often exceed 5 
3 5 acres in size, and are frequently much larger, with driveways that typically occur an average 
3 6 of every 500 feet or more. Rural roads have no geographic center, except where punctuated 
37 by rural centers. 
3 8 8. Suburban road. "Suburban road" means an area along the frontage of a road where 
3 9 incremental development slowly transitions a rural road to a suburban one. Suburban roads 
40 have more frequent curb cuts than a rural road, typically occurring an average of every 500 
41 feet or less. Buildings are typically located on lots of one to 3 acres, created through lot 
42 splits and subdivisions of larger parcels. Development typically includes a range of uses, 
43 including residential, commercial, industrial and office uses, each separated from the other. 
44 Buildings are typically located within view of the road and each other, changing the 
45 perception of the area from rural to suburban.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
ROS 
COMMIITEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 1267, L.D. 1976 
1 9. Village. "Village" means an area with a loose grouping of buildings 
2 accommodating a variety of uses and serving as a center for commerce, living, education 
3 and social interaction within a community. Villages typically include a loose network of 
4 streets, with a main street running through the center. The placement of buildings on lots, 
5 the distance between buildings and the pattern of streets and blocks are looser and more 
6 irregular than a downtown placetype. 
7 Sec. 20. Department to convene stakeholder group. Prior to initiating 
8 rulemaking as required by this Act, the Director of the Bureau of Resource Information and 
9 Land Use Planning within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry shall 
10 convene a stakeholder group for the purpose of soliciting input on the development of rules 
11 necessary to implement the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 3 0-A, chapter 187, subchapter 2, 
12 as amended by this Act. The stakeholder group may not exceed 10 members, excluding 
13 the director. Members of the stakeholder group must represent the following agencies or 
14 groups: 
15 1. The Department of Economic and Community Development; 
16 2. The Office of Policy Innovation and the Future; 
17 3, A statewide organization representing the interests of municipalities; 
18 4. A regional council established under Title 30-A, chapter 119, subchapter 1; 
19 5, An organization that advocates for the protection of natural resources; 
20 6. An organization or group that advocates for the development of affordable housing; 
21 and 
22 7. Representatives from at least 3 municipalities of varying populations and, if feasible, 
23 with varying forms of local government. 
24 Sec. 21. Department to develop guidance for public participation. The 
25 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Resource Information 
26 and Land Use Planning shall develop guidance materials describing strategies for 
27 soliciting, encouraging and incorporating public input into the development of a 
28 comprehensive plan and as required by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 
29 4324, subsection 3. At a minimum, the guidance materials must include: 
30 1. Strategies to solicit input from all demographic groups of residents, including 
31 historically underrepresented persons, through a series of public events and activities, 
32 including hands-on workshops, work sessions or focused roundtable meetings; 
33 2. Effective methods to advertise events and activities through a combination of print 
34 and digital platforms in advance of the events and activities; 
3 5 3. Multiple methods to provide opportunities for the public to contribute ideas, discuss 
36 key issues facing the community, set priorities and develop policies and strategies to 
3 7 address local challenges, including, but not limited to, seeking input through digital and 
3 8 paper surveys, questionnaires, visual preference surveys and other means; 
39 4. Methodologies to analyze the public input and use the input to prepare a draft of the 
40 comprehensive plan and meet the requirements for a comprehensive plan under Title 30-A, 
41 section 4326-A; and

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment makes several changes to the laws 
governing the growth management program, which establishes a process for 
comprehensive planning as well as a process to have a municipality's growth management 
program certified by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of 
Information Resources and Land Use Planning. Municipalities with a certified growth 
management program receive preferred status with regard to state capital investments. The 
amendment adds the following goals to the existing state goals of the program: 
1. Encouraging municipalities to focus new development in growth areas to enable 
efficient use of existing infrastructure and public services; 
2. Adding transportation infrastructure and public services to the goal of planning for 
anticipated growth; 
3. Promoting land use policies that encourage the siting and construction of attainable 
and affordable housing in reasonable proximity to jobs and services and to develop policies 
that remove barriers to housing production; 
4. Promoting the viability of agriculture, protecting access to farmland and 
safeguarding agricultural resources from development; 
5, Ensuring that policies that accommodate older residents to age in place include 
consideration of appropriate housing and transportation access; and 
6. When planning to address the effects of sea-level rise and flooding, adding a focus 
on building resilience to natural hazards. 
The amendment replaces the components of a comprehensive plan in current law and 
provides that a comprehensive plan must include the following components: inventory and 
mapping, needs analysis, the establishment of goals, implementation and strategy and a 
regional coordination program, many of which require graphic illustrations as well as 
narrative elements. 
The inventory and mapping component of the plan requires an inventory and mapping 
of environmental systems and critical natural resources to be supported by the use of 
mapping conducted by state agencies, including habitat conservation mapping done by the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife among other sources. The mapping 
component of the comprehensive plan also requires mapping of conserved areas, rural 
areas, suburban areas and centers served by infrastructure and services that support daily 
life activities such as downtowns, villages, rural centers and high-impact corridors. The 
amendment requires that the comprehensive plan identify growth areas in these centers

1 where investment, including state investment, may be necessary to implement the 
2 municipality's comprehensive plan. 
45 The needs analysis component of the plan identifies conditions that exist or should 
46 exist in the municipality because they are necessary to support housing, economic growth 
4 7 and development, public health and safety and protection of the environment. A needs 
48 analysis must demonstrate that the plan was developed with rigorous public input. The 
49 amendment also directs the department to provide guidance on best practices to engage the 
50 community in developing the comprehensive plan. 
51 The amendment requires that the plan identify goals to meet the needs identified by the 
52 plan as well as an implementation and strategy section that describes, in narrative and 
53 graphic format, how the goals will be implemented in the designated growth areas 
54 identified in the plan. 
55 The amendment requires the inclusion of a regional coordination program component 
56 of the comprehensive plan for the purpose of planning to manage shared resources and 
57 facilities with other municipalities. 
58 The amendment makes changes with regard to processes used by the Department of 
59 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to determine if a growth management program or 
60 comprehensive plan is consistent with the goals, requirements and guidelines governing 
61 the growth management program. 
62 The amendment further provides that rules adopted based on the changes made to the 
63 growth management program are major substantive rules. The amendment adds specific 
64 requirements for what must be included in the rules adopted by the Department of 
65 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and directs the department to convene a stakeholder 
66 group prior to initiating a rule-making process.

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has indicated that the changes to the rules 
regarding growth management programs, comprehensive plan requirements and the department's review criteria of 
those plans will require additional limited-period staff to assist with the policy analysis needed for rulemaking to 
incorporate the new statutory requirements. This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $133,670 starting in 
fiscal year 2024-25 to DACF for one limited-period Policy Development Specialist position and associated position 
costs and allocations of $647 for the technology management costs related to the position. The bill also includes a one­
