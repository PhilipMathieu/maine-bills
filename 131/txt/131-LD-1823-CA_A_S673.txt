7 SUMMARY
8 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
9 does the following.
10 1. It amends the law governing edible landscaping throughout Capitol Park to allow
11 collaboration with local, state or regional entities in developing and maintaining edible
12 landscaping.
13 2. It provides that strategies to end hunger in the State by 203 0 must include protecting
14 the right to food as declared in the Constitution of Maine, Article I, Section 25.
15 3. It amends the Maine Food Sovereignty Act to:
16 A. Require the State, instead of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and
17 Forestry, to support certain policies, including promoting self-reliance and personal
18 responsibility and enhancing rural economic development, and add as a policy
19 protecting the right to food as declared in the Constitution of Maine, Article I, Section
20 25;
21 B. Establish food sovereignty principles;
22 C, Apply the provisions of the Maine Food Sovereignty Act to all local food
23 ordinances, including those in place before that Act was enacted; and
24 D, Specify that the Maine Food Sovereignty Act does not require a specific form or
25 framework for local food ordinances.
26 4. It establishes the Maine Vegetable Garden Protection Act to:
27 A. Allow an individual to cultivate vegetable gardens on the individual's property or
28 on the private property of another with the permission of the owner of that property
29 anywhere in the State without interference;
30 B. Allow a municipality, county, village or plantation to develop and implement a
31 program to promote permaculture and to establish edible landscaping, food forests and
32 community gardens in public spaces, including publicly owned properties, rights-of-
33 way, school grounds, parks and parking lots, in collaboration with local, state or
34 regional public or private entities; and

6. It allows the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Parks
2 and Lands to lease land and parcels of land in parks and historic sites, nonreserved public
3 land and public reserved land for purposes of cultivating edible crops, hay or pasturage for
4 livestock, and allows that agency to give priority consideration in establishing those leases
5 to individuals with a histoiy of generational poverty or land dispossession in the United
6 States or to individuals who are veterans.
7 7. It clarifies that a plantation has the same powers and duties and is subject to the
8 same restrictions as a municipality with respect to ordinances regarding traditional
9 foodways and direct producer-to-consumer transactions under the Maine Food Sovereignty
10 Act.
11 The fiscal note on the amendment identifies certain requirements in the amendment as
12 a potential state mandate. In order to be a mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine,
13 a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as
14 to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The committee finds that the
15 section of the amendment relating to the Maine Vegetable Garden Protection Act, the
16 provision the fiscal note identifies as potentially a mandate, does not require any expansion
17 or modification of activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue.
