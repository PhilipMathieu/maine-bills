Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill prohibits carriers of health plans in this State from denying coverage to an enrollee who is a first responder
for specialized risk screening recommended by a health care provider. It also limits the ability of a health insurance
can-ier to require prior authorization for specialized risk screening and prohibits a carrier from imposing any out-of-
pocket costs for specialized screening except for high-deductible health plans offered for use in connection with a
health savings account to the extent required under federal regulations. The requirements of the bill apply to health
plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2025. The State Employee Health Plan's first impacted plan year will be
SPY 2026 and is estimated to cost $927,046 annually thereafter. The costs are split across the General Fluid
($418,548), Highway Funds ($154,472) and all other funds ($354,026).
The bill could potentially be considered a mandate by the federal government which would require the State to
reimburse the federal government for the State's defrayal cost. The potential mandate would go into effect on January
1, 2025 and would impact costs in future biennia.
