3 to read:
44.  Fees.  The fee for an initial or renewed facility sports wagering license is $4,000  
5 $1,000 and must be retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter.  In 
6 addition to the license fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed 
7 license in an amount equal to the projected cost of processing the application and 
8 performing any background investigations.  If the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, 
9 an additional fee may be charged to meet the actual cost.  If the projected cost exceeds the 
10 actual cost, the difference may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
11Sec. 2.  8 MRSA §1206, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 681, Pt. J, §6, is amended

14 under this section is valid for 4 years  one year unless sooner revoked by the director or the 
15 commissioner under section 1205.  The failure of a facility sports wagering licensee to 
16 maintain its underlying off-track betting license voids the facility sports wagering license.
17Sec. 3.  8 MRSA §1206, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 681, Pt. J, §6, is amended

20 with the application a request for a temporary license.  A request for a temporary license 
21 must include the initial license fee of $4,000  $1,000.  If the director determines that the 
22 applicant is qualified under subsection 2, meets the requirements established by rule for a 
23 temporary license and has paid the initial license fee and the director is not aware of any 
24 reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under this section, the director may issue a 
25 temporary facility sports wagering license.  A temporary license issued under this 
26 subsection is valid for one year, unless the director through collaboration with the applicant 
27 agrees to extend the term of the license, or until a final determination on the facility sports 
28 wagering license application is made, whichever is sooner.  If after investigation the 
29 director determines that the applicant is eligible for a facility sports wagering license under 
30 this chapter, the director shall issue the initial facility sports wagering license, at which 
31 time the temporary license terminates.  The initial facility sports wagering license is valid 
32 for 4 years  one year from the date that the temporary license was issued by the director.  
33 Sports wagering conducted under authority of a temporary license must comply with the 
34 facility operator's house rules adopted under section 1211.
35Sec. 4.  8 MRSA §1207, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 681, Pt. J, §6, is amended 
36 to read:
374.  Fees.  The fee for an initial or renewed mobile sports wagering license is $200,000  
38 $50,000 and must be retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter.  In 
39 addition to the license fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed 
40 license in an amount equal to the projected cost of processing the application and 
41 performing any background investigations.  If the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, 
42 an additional fee may be charged to meet the actual cost.  If the projected cost exceeds the 
43 actual cost, the difference may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
