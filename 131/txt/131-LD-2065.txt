38SUMMARY
39 This bill amends the laws governing the aquaculture leasing process in the following 
40 ways.  It eliminates provisions that are no longer applicable regarding operations that were 
41 in effect prior to January 1, 1994.  It specifies that the demonstration of financial and 
42 technical capabilities at the time of lease application is a preliminary determination.  It 
43 amends the notice requirement for standard lease applications to the general public to 
44 specify that notice must be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 1

Page 5 - 131LR2678(01)45 of the State affected and by any other manner considered appropriate by the Department of 
46 Marine Resources.  It clarifies that comments on a proposed lease renewal or a limited-
47 purpose lease application must be submitted within the 30-day deadline specified in the 
48 notice, rather than within the 30 days of receipt of the notice.  It increases from 5 to 25 the 
49 number of persons required to request a hearing on a lease renewal or a limited-purpose 
50 lease application.  It increases from 14 to 30 the number of days during which comments 
51 may be provided on a lease transfer.  Finally, it creates a process by which a person who 
52 holds a limited-purpose lease may apply to convert that lease into a standard lease, as long 
53 as it is for the same lease area and operations that were authorized by the limited-purpose 
54 lease.  A lease conversion would not require a hearing unless requested by 25 or more 
55 persons.1
