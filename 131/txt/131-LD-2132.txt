1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §1303, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
33.  Commission investigation of consumer complaints.  After participating in a non-
4 adjudicatory, informal consumer complaint resolution process conducted by the consumer 
5 assistance and safety division of the commission, the customer or public utility may petition 
6 the commission for a de novo adjudicatory proceeding to investigate the dispute. The 
7 commission shall make a final decision on the merits that is subject to Law Court review.
8SUMMARY
9 Current law gives the Public Utilities Commission discretion to deny a customer's or 
10 public utility's request that the commission conduct a formal proceeding to review the 
11 merits of a customer complaint after the customer and public utility have participated in a 
12 non-adjudicatory, informal customer complaint resolution process conducted by the 
13 consumer assistance and safety division of the commission. The Maine Supreme Judicial 
14 Court in General Marine Construction Corporation et al. v. Public Utilities Commission, 
15 2022 ME 20, 271 A.3d 1166, held that a customer or public utility is foreclosed from appeal 
16 to the Law Court if it disagrees with a non-adjudicatory, informal decision of the consumer 
17 assistance and safety division of the commission and the commission declines to hold a 
18 formal proceeding to review the merits of the dispute. This bill allows a customer or public 
19 utility, after participating in a non-adjudicatory, informal consumer complaint resolution 
20 process conducted by the consumer assistance and safety division of the commission, to 
21 petition the commission for a de novo adjudicatory proceeding to investigate the dispute 
22 and requires the commission to make a final decision on the merits that is subject to Law 
23 Court review.
