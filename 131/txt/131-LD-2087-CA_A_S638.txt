15 SUMMARY
16 This amendment replaces the bill, adds an emergency preamble and clause and changes
17 the title. It does the following.
18 1. It defines "service land" and excepts those public lands from the provision of law
19 that considers a high-impact electric transmission line crossing or utilizing public lands a
20 substantial alteration.
21 2. It prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from approving a transmission and
22 distribution utility's taking of a location for a high-impact electric transmission line by
23 eminent domain if the location is on a lot or parcel of real property that is 200 contiguous
24 acres or less and the transmission and distribution utility seeks to take less than the entire
25 property, unless the transmission and distribution utility demonstrates that, in its
26 negotiations with the owner of the property for a voluntary acquisition of the location, it
27 made both an offer for the entire property and an offer for just the location.
28 3. It clarifies the provisions of law that apply to the determination of damages for
29 property taken by eminent domain for the construction, rebuilding or relocation of a
30 high-impact electric transmission line designed to carry voltages of 5,000 volts or more and
31 of necessary appurtenances.
32 4. If a location approved by the commission for a taking by eminent domain for a
33 high-impact electric transmission line is on a lot or parcel of real property that is 200
34 contiguous acres or less and the transmission and distribution utility seeks to take less than
35 the entire property, it requires the county commissioners' estimate of damages to include 2
36 estimates, one for the entire property in fee simple absolute and one for the portion of the
37 property approved for a taking. It provides that the owner of the property has the option to
3 8 require the transmission and distribution utility to take the entire property and, if the owner
39 elects to require the transmission and distribution utility to take the entire property, the
40 commission must approve the taking of the entire property.
41 5. It requires the commission to adopt rules regarding notice and educational materials
42 that must be sent by certified mail to an owner of real property whose property may be
43 taken by eminent domain for the construction, rebuilding or relocation of a high-impact

electric transmission line, as well as to an owner whose property abuts the proposed high-
2 impact electric transmission line, by an entity selected to construct a high-impact electric
3 transmission line pursuant to the Maine Revised Statites, Title 35-A, section 3210-1,
4 subsection 2, or a transmission and distribution utility,
5 6. It establishes the circumstances under which a property owner's fees and expenses
6 associated with seeking an award of damages for property taken by eminent domain must
7 be paid by a transmission and distribution utility.
8 7. It prohibits the Department of Environmental Protection and the Board of
9 Environmental Protection from issuing an order without a hearing for a development of a
10 high-impact electric transmission line of state or regional significance that may
11 substantially affect the environment. It also requires the department to require an applicant
12 for such development to demonstrate to the department that the applicant conducted one or
13 more public meetings regarding the transmission line prior to the submission of any
14 application to the department.
15 8. It requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of
16 Parks and Lands to adopt rules pursuant to Title 12, section 598-C to provide, in the case
17 of a high-impact electric transmission line crossing or utilizing a rail trail or recreational
18 corridor or land of similar configuration designated under Title 12, chapter 202-A, criteria
19 for determining that the high-impact transmission line would not cause the land to be
