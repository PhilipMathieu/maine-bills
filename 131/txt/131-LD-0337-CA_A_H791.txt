Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, United States

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and changes the title. 
Current law governing land use ordinances states that municipalities must allow 
manufactured housing in ce1iain locations on undeveloped lots where single-family 
dwellings are allowed. The amendment provides that a municipality must allow 
manufactured housing wherever single-family dwellings are allowed, subject to the same 
design criteria as the municipality may establish for single-family dwellings.
