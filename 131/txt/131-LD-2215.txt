30SUMMARY
31 This bill implements statutory changes recommended by the Right to Know Advisory 
32 Committee after reviewing certain existing public records exceptions in the Maine Revised 
33 Statutes, Title 22.
34 The bill replaces the provisions of law governing the confidentiality of records and 
35 information under the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act.
36 The bill specifies the following.
37 1. Information that identifies a qualifying patient, a visiting qualifying patient or a 
38 registered patient is confidential and may not be disclosed by the Department of 
39 Administrative and Financial Services, except with the written consent of the patient or 
40 pursuant to a court order or a subpoena.1

Page 5 - 131LR3050(01)1 2. Information that identifies a caregiver who is exempt from registration under the 
2 Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act is confidential and may not be disclosed by the 
3 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, except with the written consent of 
4 the caregiver, pursuant to a court order or a subpoena or when necessary to protect the 
5 public from a threat to public health or safety.
6 3. Personal contact information of a registered caregiver or of an applicant for 
7 registration as a registered caregiver is confidential and may not be disclosed by the 
8 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, except with the written consent of 
9 the registrant or applicant, pursuant to a court order or a subpoena or when necessary to 
10 protect the public from a threat to public health or safety.  In addition, if the registered 
11 caregiver resides at the same address where the registered caregiver engages in activities 
12 authorized under the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act, the department may disclose 
13 that address to a state, county or municipal employee responsible for the administration of 
14 the Act or of rules, ordinances or warrant articles authorized under the Act, including a law 
15 enforcement officer or code enforcement officer.
16 4. Personal contact information of a holder of a registry identification card who is an 
17 assistant, officer or director of a registered caregiver, dispensary, manufacturing facility or 
18 cannabis testing facility or of an applicant for a registry identification card as an assistant, 
19 officer or director of a registered caregiver, dispensary, manufacturing facility or cannabis 
20 testing facility or registration certificate for a dispensary, manufacturing facility or 
21 cannabis testing facility is confidential and may not be disclosed by the Department of 
22 Administrative and Financial Services, except in response to a court order or a subpoena.
23 5. A final written decision of the Department of Administrative and Financial Services 
24 imposing an administrative penalty, ordering forfeiture and destruction of cannabis or 
25 suspending or revoking a registry identification card or registration certificate is not 
26 confidential.
27 The bill preserves the obligation of the Department of Administrative and Financial 
28 Services under current law to provide information to the department's Bureau of Revenue 
29 Services for the administration and enforcement of taxes and the requirement in current 
30 law that law enforcement officers obtain a warrant before they may require a caregiver, 
31 dispensary, manufacturing facility or cannabis testing facility to disclose information that 
32 could reasonably identify an individual or require a person who accompanies a patient to 
33 disclose information that could reasonably identify a patient.
34 The bill clarifies that a record relating to a medical examiner case is confidential and 
35 that the location or custodian of the record does not affect the record's confidentiality. It 
36 also makes other technical and grammatical changes to conform with drafting standards 
37 recommended by the Right to Know Advisory Committee.
38 The bill clarifies that a professional or occupational licensing board that receives 
39 confidential information from the Director of the Office of Child and Family Services or 
40 the Director of the Office of MaineCare Services within the Department of Health and 
41 Human Services may release that confidential information during the pendency of an 
42 investigation as long as that confidential information is not further disclosed for any other 
43 purpose.
44 The bill clarifies that any personally identifiable information obtained by the Maine 
45 Health Insurance Marketplace is confidential. 
Page 6 - 131LR3050(01)1 The bill also makes technical and grammatical changes and corrects a cross-reference.
