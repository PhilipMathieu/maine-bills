Page 1 - 131LR2786(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation requires the establishment of a statewide sexual assault 
4 forensic examination kit tracking system and an inventory of all sexual assault forensic 
5 examination kits in the possession of law enforcement agencies; and
6Whereas, the immediate passage of this legislation is critical to strengthen the State's 
7 enforcement of sexual assault laws and response to sexual assault; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13Sec. 1.  24 MRSA §2986, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2019, c. 94, §1, is further 
14 amended to read:
153.  Completed kit.  If the alleged victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law 
16 enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care 
17 practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport and 
18 store the completed forensic examination kit for 8  20 years.  The completed kit may be 
19 identified only by the tracking number.  If during that storage period an alleged victim 
20 decides to report the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency, the alleged victim may 
21 contact the hospital or health care practitioner to determine the tracking number.  The 
22 hospital or health care practitioner shall provide the alleged victim with the tracking 
23 number on the forensic examination kit and shall inform the alleged victim which law 
24 enforcement agency is storing the kit.
25 If the alleged victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time 
26 the examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic 
27 examination kit.
28 If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the alleged victim does not, within 
29 60 days, regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the 
30 alleged offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to storing or 
31 processing the forensic examination kit.  Upon finding good cause and after considering 
32 factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in processing the 
33 kit and the likelihood of the alleged victim's regaining a state of consciousness adequate to 
34 decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a reasonable time, the District Court 
35 may order either that the kit be stored for additional time or that the kit be transported to 
36 the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing, or such other disposition that the 
37 court determines just.  In the interests of justice or upon motion by the State, the District 
38 Court may conduct hearings required under this paragraph confidentially and in camera 
39 and may impound pleadings and other records related to them.
40Sec. 2.  25 MRSA §2915-A is enacted to read:
