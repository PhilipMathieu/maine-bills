SENATE AMENDMENT''/',-" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to liP. 1308, L.D. 2046( S ·5Cfl) 
A. The commissioner may terminate the placement of a defendant accepted pursuant 
to this section if the commissioner determines that the likelihood of serious harm posed 
by the defendant has decreased or the security at a state mental health institute has 
increased or for any other reason. 
B. At any time after 90 days of placement in a mental health unit of a correctional 
facility, except not within 60 days of resolution of a prior petition under this paragraph, 
the defendant may petition the court for return to placement in a less restrictive setting 
on the grounds that the criteria for placement under subsection 1 no longer exist. If a 
petition is filed under this paragraph, the court shall hold a hearing and issue a decision 
maintaining or terminating the placement. 
4. Disclosure of information. With respect to a defendant who has previously been 
hospitalized under Title 34-B, chapter 3, subchapter 4, the commissioner may make it a 
prerequisite to accepting placement of the defendant under this section that necessary 
information be disclosed to the department pursuant to Title 34-B, section 1207, subsection 
1, paragraph B. 
5. Application of other laws. All other applicable provisions of law governing 
defendants found incompetent to stand trial apply to defendants accepted for placement 
under this section. 
6. Repeal. This section is repealed November 1, 2027.' 
Amend the amendment by inserting after section 4 the following: 
'Amend the bill by striking out all of the emergency clause.' 
Amend the amendment by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause from the bill. 
Because the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-A, section 3069-C is scheduled to be repealed 
on July 1, 2024, and this amendment will not take effect prior to July 1, 2024, this 
amendment enacts the provisions of Title 34-A, section 3069-C as Title 34-A, section 
3069-D but changes the repeal date to November 1, 2027. 
The amendment removes the provision added in Committee Amendment "A" that 
requires a court to terminate placement of a defendant in a mental health unit if the court 
finds by clear and convincing evidence that the placement of the defendant is not the least 
restrictive placement appropriate for the defendant. 
The amendment retains the provisions of the committee amendment regarding the 
stakeholder group and a reporting requirement.
