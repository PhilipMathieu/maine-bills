1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to enact the PA Licensure Compact to increase the availability of 
6 medical services provided by physician assistants by mutual recognition of a physician 
7 assistant's qualifying license by other states participating in the compact. This compact also 
8 would adopt the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and affirms that the 
9 practice and delivery of medical services by the physician assistant occurs where the patient 
10 is located at the time of the patient encounter, placing the physician assistant under the 
11 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. A state licensing board 
12 that participates in this compact would retain jurisdiction to impose adverse action against 
13 the authorization provided under the compact in that state and issued to a physician assistant 
14 through the procedures of the compact. The compact would alleviate burdens for military 
15 families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain 
16 authorization to provide medical services as long as those persons have an unrestricted 
17 license in good standing from a state participating in the compact.
18 The verbatim text of the PA Licensure Compact, which has not been edited to make 
19 necessary, nonsubstantive changes to conform to Maine legislative drafting standards, 
20 reads as follows.
21PA LICENSURE COMPACT
22Section 1. Purpose
23 In order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in recognition of the advances in the 
24 delivery of Medical Services, the Participating States of the PA Licensure Compact have 
25 allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the 
26 existing authority of State Licensing Boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to 
27 enhance the portability of a License to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of 
28 patients. This Compact allows Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual 
29 recognition of the Licensee's Qualifying License by other Compact Participating States. 
30 This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the 
31 practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at 
32 the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction 
33 of the State Licensing Board where the patient is located. State Licensing Boards that 
34 participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action against a 
35 Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The 
36 PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty 
37 military personnel and their spouses to obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an 
38 unrestricted License in good standing from a Participating State.

39 attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of

41 for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of 
42 evidence from another Participating State shall be enforced in the latter

47 State in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
8 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, subpoenas may not be issued by a

11 a Licensee's Compact Privilege or application for a Compact Privilege in 
12 that Participating State.
13 4. Nothing in this Compact authorizes a Participating State to impose 
14 discipline against a PA's Compact Privilege or to deny an application for a 
15 Compact Privilege in that Participating State for the individual's otherwise 
16 lawful practice in another State.
17 C.  For purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Participating State which issued the 
18 Qualifying License shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct 
19 received from any other Participating State as it would if the conduct had occurred 
20 within the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License. In so doing, 
21 that Participating State shall apply its own State laws to determine appropriate 
22 action.

24 affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any

34 2. Participating States shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance 
35 materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated 
36 under this Compact.
37 G.  If an Adverse Action is taken against a PA's Qualifying License, the PA's Compact 
38 Privilege in all Remote States shall be deactivated until two (2) years have elapsed 
39 after all restrictions have been removed from the State License. All disciplinary 
40 orders by the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License that impose 
41 Adverse Action against a PA's License shall include a Statement that the PA's

13 and in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property 
14 or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any 
15 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person 
16 against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing 
17 occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or 
18 responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed 
19 to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury,

24 employee, and representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking 
25 to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission 
26 that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or 
27 responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person against 
28 whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred 
29 within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; 
30 provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from 
31 retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and provided further, that 
32 the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that person's 
33 intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
34 3. The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, 
35 executive director, employee, and representative of the Commission for the 
36 amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising

38 scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such 
39 person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of 
40 Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the 
41 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional 
42 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
43 4.  Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall 
44 be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where 
45 the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may 
Page 13 - 131LR2722(01)
46 waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in any proceedings as authorized 
47 by Commission Rules.
3 5. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any 
4 Licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be 
5 governed solely by any other applicable State laws.
6 6. Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or jurisdiction to 
7 bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional misconduct, 
8 negligence, or other such civil action pertaining to the practice of a PA.  All 
9 such matters shall be determined exclusively by State law other than this 
10 Compact.
11 7. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate 
12 a Participating State's state action immunity or state action affirmative 
13 defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton 
14 Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or 
15 regulation.
16 8. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign

20 utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system containing licensure, 
21 Adverse Action, and the reporting of the existence of Significant Investigative 
22 Information on all licensed PAs and applicants denied a License in Participating 
23 States.
24 B. Notwithstanding any other State law to the contrary, a Participating State shall 
25 submit a uniform data set to the Data System on all PAs to whom this Compact is 
26 applicable (utilizing a unique identifier) as required by the Rules of the 
27 Commission, including:
28 1. Identifying information;
29 2. Licensure data;
30 3. Adverse Actions against a License or Compact Privilege;
31 4. Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason(s) for such denial 
32 (excluding the reporting of any Criminal history record information where 
33 prohibited by law);
34 5. The existence of Significant Investigative Information; and
35 6. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this Compact, as 
36 determined by the Rules of the Commission.

38 State shall only be available to other Participating States.
39 D. The Commission shall promptly notify all Participating States of any Adverse

Page 14 - 131LR2722(01)
1 E. Participating States contributing information to the Data System may, in 
2 accordance with State or federal law, designate information that may not be shared 
3 with the public without the express permission of the contributing State. 
4 Notwithstanding any such designation, such information shall be reported to the 
5 Commission through the Data System.
6 F. Any information submitted to the Data System that is subsequently expunged 
7 pursuant to federal law or the laws of the Participating State contributing the 
8 information shall be removed from the Data System upon reporting of such by the 
9 Participating State to the Commission.
10 G. The records and information provided to a Participating State pursuant to this 
11 Compact or through the Data System, when certified by the Commission or an 
12 agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the 
13 Commission, and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any 
14 relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a Participating 
15 State.
16Section 9. Rulemaking
17 A. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set 
18 forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Commission Rules shall 
19 become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for each Rule.
20 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively and 
21 efficiently implement and administer this Compact and achieve its purposes. A 
22 Commission Rule shall be invalid and have not force or effect only if a court of 
23 competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission 
24 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the 
25 purposes of this Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another 
26 applicable standard of review.
27 C. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Participating 
28 State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the 
29 laws of the Participating State that establish the medical services a PA may perform 
30 in the Participating State, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of 
31 the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
32 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States rejects a Commission 
33 Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this 
34 Compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule 
35 shall have no further force and effect in any Participating State or to any State 
36 applying to participate in the Compact.
37 E. Commission Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the 
38 Commission.
39 F. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or Rules by the Commission, 
40 and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Rule will be 
41 considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed 
42 Rulemaking:
43 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform; 
44 and
Page 15 - 131LR2722(01)
1 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices of 
2 proposed rulemaking, and
3 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
4 G. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
5 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing on the proposed Rule and 
6 the proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the proposed 
7 Rule will be considered and voted upon;
8 2. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason for the proposed Rule;
9 3. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person 
10 and the date by which written comments must be received; and
11 4. The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the 
12 Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide any 
13 written comments.
14 H.   Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit   
15 written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the 
16 public.
17 I. If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the Commission shall publish the 
18 mechanism for access to the electronic hearing. 
19 1. All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall as directed in the Notice 
20 of Proposed Rulemaking, not less than five (5) business days before the 
21 scheduled date of the hearing, notify the Commission of their desire to 
22 appear and testify at the hearing.
23 2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes 
24 to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in 
25 writing.
26 3. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written 
27 comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in response to the 
28 proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon request.
29 4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on 
30 each proposed Rule. Proposed Rules may be grouped for the convenience 
31 of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
32 J. Following the public hearing the Commission shall consider all written and oral 
33 comments timely received.
34 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the 
35 proposed Rule and shall determine the effective date of the Rule, if adopted, based 
36 on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
37 1. If adopted, the Rule shall be posted on the Commission's website.
38 2. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the 
39 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
Page 16 - 131LR2722(01)
1 3. The Commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons 
2 for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for 
3 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
4 4. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. 
5 Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L, the effective date of 
6 the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the Commission 
7 issued the notice that it adopted the Rule.
8 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and 
9 adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four (24) hours prior notice, without the 
10 opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking 
11 procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be retroactively 
12 applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety 
13 (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an 
14 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the Commission in 
15 order to:
16 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
17 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
18 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Commission Rule that is 
19 established by federal law or Rule; or
20 4. Protect public health and safety.
21 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct 
22 revisions to a previously adopted Commission Rule for purposes of correcting 
23 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. 
24 Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. 
25 The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) 
26 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the 
27 revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made as set 
28 forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of 
29 the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without 
30 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without 
31 the approval of the Commission.
32 N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
33Section 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement
34 A. Oversight
35 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each 
36 Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary 
37 and appropriate to implement the Compact.
38 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission 
39 shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction 
40 where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission 
41 may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or 
42 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. 
43 Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in 
Page 17 - 131LR2722(01)
44 any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or 
45 any such similar matter.
3 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any 
4 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or 
5 the Commission's Rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a 
6 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with service 
7 of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as to 
8 the Commission, this Compact, or Commission Rules. 
9 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
10 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has defaulted in the 
11 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the       
12 Commission Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 
13 defaulting State and other Participating States.  The notice shall describe 
14 the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action 
15 that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific 
16 technical assistance regarding the default.
17 2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be 
18 terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 
19 delegates of the Participating States, and all rights, privileges and benefits 
20 conferred by this Compact upon such State may be terminated on the 
21 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 
22 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 
23 default.
24 3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed only after all 
25 other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent 
26 to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, 
27 the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and 
28 to the Licensing Board(s) of each of the Participating States.
29 4. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 
30 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of 
31 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of 
32 termination.
33 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to 
34 be in default or that has been terminated from this Compact, unless agreed 
35 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.
36 6. The defaulting State may appeal its termination from the Compact by the 
37 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of 
38 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal 
39 offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, 
40 including reasonable attorney's fees.
41 7. Upon the termination of a State's participation in the Compact, the State 
42 shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such 
43 termination: 
1
2
Page 18 - 131LR2722(01)
1 a. Licensees who have been granted a Compact Privilege in that State 
2 shall retain the Compact Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) 
3 days following the effective date of such termination.
4 b. Licensees who are licensed in that State who have been granted a 
5 Compact Privilege in a Participating State shall retain the Compact 
6 Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days unless the Licensee 
7 also has a Qualifying License in a Participating State or obtains a 
8 Qualifying License in a Participating State before the one hundred 
9 eighty (180)-day period ends, in which case the Compact Privilege 
10 shall continue.
11 C. Dispute Resolution
12 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall attempt to 
13 resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among Participating 
14 States and between participating and non-Participating States.
15 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and 
16 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
17 D. Enforcement
18 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce 
19 the provisions of this Compact and Rules of the Commission.
20 2. If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been 
21 exhausted, by majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in 
22 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal 
23 district where the Commission has its principal offices, against a 
24 Participating State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of 
25 this Compact and the Commission's promulgated Rules and bylaws. The 
26 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 
27 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all 
28 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
29 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. 
30 The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or 
31 State law.
32 E. Legal Action Against the Commission
33 1. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the Commission in 
34 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 
35 where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with 
36 the provisions of the Compact and its Rules. The relief sought may include 
37 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 
38 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, 
39 including reasonable attorney's fees.
40 2. No person other than a Participating State shall enforce this Compact 
41 against the Commission.
42Section 11. Date of Implementation of the PA Licensure Compact Commission
Page 19 - 131LR2722(01)
1 A. This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which this Compact statute is 
2 enacted into law in the seventh Participating State. 
3 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall 
4 convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted the 
5 Compact prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating 
6 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 
7 Participating State is materially different than the Model Compact.
8 a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is found to be 
9 materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to 
10 the default process set forth in Section 10.B.
11 b. If any Participating State later withdraws from the Compact or its 
12 participation is terminated, the Commission shall remain in 
13 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 
14 of Participating States should be less than seven. Participating 
15 States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Commission 
16 convening shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.21 
17 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the 
18 Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the 
19 Compact.
20 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial 
21 Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in 
22 Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are materially different from 
23 the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the 
24 Compact.
25 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the 
26 purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of 
27 the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 
28 to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the 
29 Commission.
30 B. Any State that joins this Compact shall be subject to the Commission's Rules and 
31 bylaws as they exist on the date on which this Compact becomes law in that State. 
32 Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full 
33 force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in that State.
34 C. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute 
35 repealing the same.
36 1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred 
37 eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.  During this one 
38 hundred eighty (180) day-period, all Compact Privileges that were in effect 
39 in the withdrawing State and were granted to Licensees licensed in the 
40 withdrawing State shall remain in effect.  If any Licensee licensed in the 
41 withdrawing State is also licensed in another Participating State or obtains 
42 a license in another Participating State within the one hundred eighty (180) 
43 days, the Licensee's Compact Privileges in other Participating States shall 
44 not be affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty (180) days.
Page 20 - 131LR2722(01)
1 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the State 
2 Licensing Board(s) of the withdrawing State to comply with the 
3 investigative, and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact 
4 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
5 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a State from this Compact, the 
6 State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees 
7 within that State. Such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all 
8 licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred 
9 eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
10 D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any 
11 PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between Participating 
12 States and between a Participating State and non-Participating State that does not 
13 conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
14 E. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No amendment to this 
15 Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Participating State until it 
16 is enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all Participating States as 
17 determined by the Commission.
18Section 12. Construction and Severability
19 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally 
20 construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and 
21 administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing 
22 or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 
23 Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 
24 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, 
25 sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction 
26 to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking 
27 participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to 
28 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by 
29 a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and 
30 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance 
31 shall not be affected thereby. 
32 C. Notwithstanding subsection B or this section, the Commission may deny a State's 
33 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of 
34 Section10.B, terminate a Participating State's participation in the Compact, if it 
35 determines that a constitutional requirement of a Participating State is, or would be 
36 with respect to a State seeking to participate in the Compact, a material departure 
37 from the Compact.  Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the 
38 constitution of any Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full force and 
39 effect as to the remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to the 
40 Participating State affected as to all severable matters.
41Section 13. Binding Effect of Compact
42 A. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Participating State 
43 that is not inconsistent with this Compact.
Page 21 - 131LR2722(01)
1 B. Any laws in a Participating State in conflict with this Compact are superseded to 
2 the extent of the conflict.
3 C. All agreements between the Commission and the Participating States are binding 
4 in accordance with their terms.
