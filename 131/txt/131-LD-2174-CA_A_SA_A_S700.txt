Fiscal Detail and Notes
This amendment removes multiple prohibitions on a health care provider related to arranging for or establishing an
application for open-end credit or loan product that contains a deferred interest rate, accepting payment for the costs
of health care services using an open-end credit or loan product that contains a deferred interest rate or advertising or
promoting an open-end credit or loan product as having a zero interest rate if the open-end credit or loan product has a
deferred interest rate. Removal of these provisions eliminates the need for one Consumer Credit Examiner position to
examine health care providers to ensure compliance with open-end credit and loan requirements. The position and the
allocation for the position are removed.
