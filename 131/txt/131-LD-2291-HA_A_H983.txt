HOUSE AMENDMENT" A" to 1-1.P. 1480, L.D, 2291 
3. Judicial review. The Supreme Judicial Cou1t has original jurisdiction to 
hear any challenge to an app01tionment law enacted by the Legislature, as registered 
by any citizen or group of citizens. If a challenge is sustained, the Supreme Judicial 
Court shall make the apportionment. 
Section 25. Apportionment of county comm1ss10ner districts. County 
commissioner districts must be appo1tioned as follows. 
1. Redistricting, generally. Beginning in 2021 and every 10 years thereafter, 
the apportionment commission established under Article IV, Pait Third, Section 1 ~A 
shall review the existing county commissioner districts and, as necessary, reapportion 
those districts in each county to establish as nearly as practicable equally populated 
districts. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is responsible for calling the 
commission together to review the county commissioner districts. No action may be 
taken by the commission without a quorum of 7. 
A. The apportionment commission shall divide the number of commissioners 
in each county into the number of inhabitants of the county, excluding 
foreigners not naturalized, according to the latest Federal Decennial Census or 
a state census previously ordered by the Legislature to coincide with the Federal 
Decennial Census, to determine a mean population figure for each county 
commissioner district. Each county commissioner district must be formed of 
contiguous and compact territory and must cross political subdivision lines the 
least number of times necessary to establish as nearly as practicable equally 
populated districts. Whenever the population of a municipality entitles it to 
more than one district, all whole districts must be drawn within the municipal 
boundaries. Any population remainder within the municipality must be 
included in a district drawn to cross the municipal boundary as long as the 
population remainder within the municipality is contiguous to another 
municipality or municipalities included in the district. Any county that already 
meets the standards and guidelines for equally populated districts, as established 
by this section, this Constitution and the Constitution of the United States, need 
not be reapp01tioned. 
B. Interested paities from each county may submit redistricting plans for the 
commission to consider. Those plans must be submitted to the commission no 
later than 30 calendar days after the commission is called together by the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives under this subsection. The 
commission may hold public hearings on plans affecting each county.

Representatives no later than June 1st of the year in which apportionment is 
required. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall submit to the 
Legislature, no later than January 15, 2022, and every 10th year thereafter, one 
legislative document to reapportion the county commissioner districts based on 
the plan submitted by the apportiomnent commission. The Legislature must

vote of2/3 of the members of each House within 30 calendar days after the plan 
is submitted to it by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. This action is 
subject to the Governor's approval, as provided in Article IV, Part Third, Section 
2. 
13 2. Supreme Judicial Court. If the Legislature fails to make an apportionment 
14 within the 30 calendar days, the Supreme Judicial Court shall make the apportionment 
15 within 60 calendar days following the period in which the Legislature is required to act 
16 but fails to do so. In making the apportionment, the Supreme Judicial Court shall

33 sent to the selectmen of the several towns, and the assessors of the several plantations,

the said separation, continue the same as if the said district was still a part of this 
commonwealth, in all suits pending, or judgments remaining unsatisfied on the fifteenth

process has been served within the district of Maine; or conm1enced in the district of 
Maine, and process has been served in Massachusetts proper, either by taking bail, 
making attachments, arresting and detaining persons, or otherwise, where execution 
remains to be done; and in such suits the courts within Massachusetts proper, and within 
the proposed state, shall continue to have the same jurisdiction as if the said district had

2024 REARRANGEMENT NOTES 
of Chief Justice Valerie Stanfill 
20 Article X, section 7 was repealed by Const. Res. 2023, ch. 1, passed in 2023. 
21 As a result, sections 1, 2 and 5 of aiticle X may be printed. Under aiticle X, section 
22 6 of the Maine Constitution, however, in arranging the Constitution to be printed 
23 the Chief Justice is required to omit "all sections, clauses and words not in force.,, 
24 Upon review of sections 1 and 2 for inclusion in the printing, it is patently clear on 
25 the face of each section that neither remains in force. They both pertain only to the 
26 first Legislature, which has long since adjourned. As a result, sections 1 and 2 have 
27 been omitted from article X. 
28 Section 5 is incorporated in this rearrangement because it is not evident from 
29 the plain text of this section that it is not in force. Section 5 of a1ticle X was also 
30 previously not printed pursuant to the now-repealed seventh section of article X. 
31 There are multiple versions of section 5 in existence before the 1875 passage of 
32 section 7, see Resolves 1875, ch. 98, approved in 1875, although the differences 
33 appear non-substantive. This arrangement incorporates the iteration of section 5 that 
34 appeared in the last officially published version of the Maine Constitution before 
35 the section was ordered not to be printed. See R.S. (1871) at 42~46.' 
36 Amend the resolve by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Pait letter or 
37 section number to read consecutively.

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces Appendix A, the Constitution of Maine, to replace A1ticle X, 
Section 5 with the version submitted by the Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial 
Court, which was the last version of Section 5 that was printed before it was required to 
not be pl'inted, 
This amendment also removes the Revisor's Note, which noted that, due to a large 
number of transcription errors contained in the last officially published version of Article 
X, Section 5 in 1875, the version that was included in the original resolve was the version 
as approved in 1820.
