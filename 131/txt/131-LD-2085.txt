1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, on June 27, 2023, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in 
4Counterman v. Colorado, which has raised questions as to the constitutionality of several 
5 of Maine's statutes; and
6Whereas, the statutes implicated include critical components of the State's public 
7 safety response, specifically including its response to domestic violence and stalking; and
8Whereas, citizens of the State rely on the Legislature to ensure a constitutionally 
9 sound criminal and civil justice system and failure to timely align the statutes with the new 
10 federal standard may result in unnecessary litigation in the State's already overburdened 
11 state court system; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15 therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §210, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2003, c. 143, §4, is further 
18 amended to read:
191.   A person is guilty of terrorizing if that person in fact  intentionally, knowingly or 
20 recklessly communicates to any person a threat to commit or to cause to be committed a 
21 crime of violence dangerous to human life, against the person to whom the communication 
22 is made or another, and consciously disregarding a risk that the natural and probable 
23 consequence of such a threat, whether or not such consequence in fact occurs, is:
24 A.  To place the person to whom the threat is communicated or the person threatened 
25 in reasonable fear that the crime will be committed.  Violation of this paragraph is a 
26 Class D crime; or
27 B.  To cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly or facility of public transport 
28 or to cause the occupants of a building to be moved to or required to remain in a 
29 designated secured area.  Violation of this paragraph is a Class C crime.
30Sec. 2.  17-A MRSA §210-A, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2007, c. 685, §1, is 
31 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
32 A.  "Course of conduct" means 2 or more acts, including but not limited to acts in which 
33 the actor, by any action, method, device or means, directly or indirectly:
34 (1)  Follows, monitors, tracks, observes, surveils or harasses a person;
35 (2)  Interferes with a person's property;
36 (3)  Threatens a person, consciously disregarding a risk that the actor's conduct 
37 would cause a reasonable person to experience any of the effects identified in 
38 subsection 1, paragraph A; or
39 (4)  Communicates to or about a person, consciously disregarding a risk that the 
40 actor's conduct would cause a reasonable person to experience any of the effects 
41 identified in subsection 1, paragraph A. 
Page 2 - 131LR2832(01)
1 "Course of conduct" also includes, but is not limited to, threats implied by conduct and 
2 gaining unauthorized access to personal, medical, financial or other identifying or 
3 confidential information.  
4Sec. 3.  17-A MRSA §506, sub-§1, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 397, §1, is 
5 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
6 A.  By means of telephone or electronic communication device the person 
7 intentionally, knowingly or recklessly makes any comment, request, suggestion or 
8 proposal without the consent of the person called or contacted:
9 (1)  That is, in fact, obscene; or
10 (2)  With conscious disregard of a risk that a reasonable person would find the 
11 comment, request, suggestion or proposal offensively coarse.
12 Violation of this paragraph is a Class E crime;
13Sec. 4.  19-A MRSA §4102, sub-§1, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 647, Pt. A, §3 
14 and affected by Pt. B, §65, is amended to read:
15 B.  Attempting to place or placing another in fear of bodily injury, regardless of intent, 
16 through any course of conduct, including, but not limited to, threatening, harassing or 
17 tormenting behavior.  When the course of conduct violates this paragraph based on the 
18 content of the actor's speech, the actor must have consciously disregarded a risk that 
19 the speech would place a reasonable person in fear of bodily injury;
20Sec. 5.  19-A MRSA §4102, sub-§1, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 647, Pt. A, §3 
21 and affected by Pt. B, §65, is amended to read:
22 E.  Communicating to a person a threat to commit, or to cause to be committed, a crime 
23 of violence dangerous to human life against the person to whom the communication is 
24 made or another, and with conscious disregard of a risk that the natural and probable 
25 consequence of the threat, whether or not that consequence in fact occurs, is to place 
26 the person to whom the threat is communicated, or the person against whom the threat 
27 is made, in reasonable fear that the crime will be committed;  
28Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
29 takes effect when approved.
30SUMMARY
31 This bill aligns the laws of this State with the new federal standard set by Counterman 
32v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66 (2023). It amends relevant sections of the Maine Criminal Code 
33 and the protection from abuse laws to provide that, with respect to a violation of the abuse 
34 laws or the crime of terrorizing, stalking or harassment by telephone based on the content 
35 of the actor's speech, the actor must have consciously disregarded a risk that the actor's 
36 speech would place a reasonable person in fear of bodily injury.
