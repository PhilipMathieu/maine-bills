COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 148, L.D. 227 
1 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Pait letter or section 
2 number to read consecutively. 
3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill, which 
5 is a concept draft, and changes the title. The amendment provides protections to persons 
6 who seek, health care practitioners who provide and those who assist health care 
7 practitioners in providing gender-affirming health care services and reproductive health 
8 care services in accordance with the applicable standard of care. 
9 Pait A of the amendment does the following. 
10 1, It establishes that access to gender-affirming health care services and reproductive 
11 health care services, when those services are authorized under the laws of this State, is a 
12 legal right and that interference with access to such services or the provision of such 
13 services is against the public policy of this State, 
14 2. It defines ''legally protected health care activity" as the exercise or attempted 
15 exercise of the right to gender-affinning health care services 01· reproductive health care 
16 services secured in this State as well as the provision or attempted provision of gender-
17 affirming health care services or reproductive health care services authorized under the 
18 laws of this State by a health care practitioner licensed and physically present in this State, 
19 regardless of whether the patient is located in this State or the health care practitioner is 
20 licensed in the state where the patient is located. "Legally protected health care activity" 
21 does not include conduct that could form the basis of civil, criminal or administrative 
22 liability under the laws of this State had the course of conduct occurred entirely within this 
23 State. 
24 3. It authorizes a health care practitioner or person assisting a health care practitioner 
25 against whom a civil, criminal or administrative action in another state is brought to deter, 
26 prevent, sanction or punish that health care practitioner for engaging in legally protected 
27 health care activity or that person for aiding and assisting legally protected health care 
28 activity, referred to in the amendment as "hostile litigation," to bring a civil action in this 
29 State for damages, punitive damages and equitable relief. A couit in this State may include 
30 in a damage award the amount of any judgment issued in connection with the hostile 
31 litigation as well as the person's reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in 
32 connection with that action. 
33 4. It requires a person seeking to enforce in this State a judgment from another state, 
34 referred to in the amendment as a 11 foreignjudgment, 11 in connection with hostile litigation 
35 to bring an action on the judgment within 5 years. A comt in this State may not enforce a 
36 foreign judgment in connection with hostile litigation if the couit that issued the judgment 
3 7 lacked jurisdiction or failed to provide due process of law, 
38 5, It provides that, unless required by federal law, a court of this State may not order a 
39 person in this State to give testimony or produce documents or other information in any 
40 proceeding involving hostile litigation, In addition, unless required by federal law, a comt 
41 in this State may not issue a summons or warrant in a case involving a grand jury 
42 investigation of or prosecution under the criminal laws of another state for engaging in or 
43 for aiding and assisting legally protected health care activity unless the conduct at issue 
44 would constitute a criminal offense if it had occurred entirely within this State,

6. It prohibits public agencies, including law enforcement agencies, from knowingly 
cooperating with or expending public resources in furtherance of an investigation or 
proceeding against a person for engaging in or aiding and assisting legally protected health 
care activity. It also prohibits the arrest of a person in this State if the arrest is related to 
criminal liability for engaging in or aiding and assisting legally protected health care 
activity. The amendment does not prohibit a public agency, including a law enforcement 
agency, from cooperating or assisting an investigation or proceeding or from responding to 
a warrant or extradition demand on the good faith belief that the warrant or demand is valid 
in this State or when exigent circumstances make compliance impossible. 
7. It provides that the laws of this State apply to any case or controversy heard in this 
State involving legally protected health care activity or aiding and assisting legally 
protected health care activity. 
Part B of the amendment amends the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery 
Act, through which a person may request that a court in this State issue a subpoena to 
effectuate a subpoena issued under the authority of a court in another state, referred to as a 
"foreign subpoena." Under the amendment, a person submitting a foreign subpoena to a 
clerk of coutt must also submit an affidavit attesting whether the foreign subpoena seeks 
documents, information, inspection or testimony related to the provision or receipt of 
legally protected health care activity or aiding and assisting legally protected health care 
activity. If the affidavit reveals that the foreign subpoena is related to legally protected 
health care activity or aiding and assisting legally protected health care activity, the clerk 
may not issue the subpoena and must present the request to the comt. The cou1t must deny 
the request unless it finds that the foreign subpoena seeks documents, information, 
inspection or testimony related to specified types of civil actions either brought by a person 
or brought under a contract for which a similar cause of action exists under the laws of this 
State. 
Part C of the amendment amends the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act to prohibit the 
Governor from surrendering a person charged in another state for engaging in or aiding and 
assisting legally protected health care activity unless the executive authority in the other 
state alleges that the accused was physically present in the other state when the alleged 
offense was committed and thereafter fled the other state. 
In addition, Patt C of the amendment prohibits a coutt in this State from issuing a 
search warrant authorizing a government entity to obtain p01table electronic device content 
information that relates to an investigation into legally protected health care activity or 
aiding and assisting legally protected health care activity. 
Pait D of the amendment provides that a health care practitioner that provides services 
related to legally protected health care activity may pa1ticipate in the Address 
Confidentiality Program administered by the Secretary of State. 
Current law prohibits an insurer that provides medical malpractice insurance in this 
State from discriminating or taking any adverse action against a health care professional 
who provides reproductive health care services on the sole basis that the health care 
professional is acting in violation of another state's law or is subject to an adverse action 
against the health care professional's license in another state. Pait E of the amendment 
extends analogous protections to health care practitioners who engage in or aid and assist 
legally protected health care activity as defined in Patt A of the amendment.
