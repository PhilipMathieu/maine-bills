Fiscal Note
Current biennium savings - General Fund
Minor revenue decrease - General Fund
Minor revenue decrease - Other Special Revenue Funds
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements
Stipulates that in the case of a Class C crime for theft, if a person has 2 or more prior convictions, the value of the
property must be more than $500, This requirement would reduce the number of people convicted for this crime. It is
unclear how many fewer additional individuals will be convicted of a Class C crime who otherwise would have been.
The current average cost of incarcerating one individual for a single year is $55,203. No appropriations have been
reduced in. the bill.
There may be some minor reduction of workload associated with the minimal number of felony cases that will no
longer be filed in the court system. Reductions in the collection of fines will decrease General Fund or other
dedicated revenue by minor amounts,
