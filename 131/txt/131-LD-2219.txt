29SUMMARY
30 This bill implements the recommendations of the Maine Commission on Indigent 
31 Legal Services to make the following changes to laws governing the commission and 
32 related provisions of law.
33 1.  In the laws governing the commission, it defines the term "employed counsel" to 
34 refer to a person employed by the commission to provide direct legal services to persons 
35 who receive indigent legal services, formerly referred to in those laws as "public 
36 defenders."
37 2.  It provides that the 2 members of the commission who are attorneys engaged in the 
38 active practice of law and who provide indigent legal services are voting members of the 
39 commission.
40 3. It requires that the executive director of the commission be an attorney licensed to 
41 practice law and a member in good standing of the bar of the State.1

Page 12 - 131LR3049(01)1 4. It specifies that when the commission through employed counsel retains 
2 investigative and expert services that are reasonably necessary for case-specific purposes, 
3 those services are not required to be made through the state procurement process.
4 5. It clarifies that any information subject to a privilege under the Maine Rules of 
5 Evidence or the Maine Rules of Professional Conduct or otherwise protected by the 
6 attorney-client privilege remains confidential when it is in the possession or control of the 
7 commission or when it is received, obtained, maintained or stored by or on behalf of 
8 employed counsel.
9 6. It clarifies that, although information obtained or gathered by the commission 
10 through a formal or informal complaint or when performing an evaluation or investigation 
11 of an attorney is generally confidential, if the attorney appeals from a decision finding the 
12 attorney ineligible to receive case assignments, the information may be disclosed at a public 
13 hearing conducted by the commission on the appeal unless the information is protected by 
14 the attorney-client privilege or by any other provision of law, the Maine Rules of Evidence 
15 or the Maine Rules of Professional Conduct.
16 7. It establishes immunity from suit under the Maine Tort Claims Act for the 
17 commission and its employees for claims based on performing or failing to perform any 
18 indigent legal services.  The immunity provided by the bill mirrors the immunity from suit 
19 granted under the Maine Tort Claims Act to governmental entities and their employees for 
20 performing or failing to perform any prosecutorial function involving civil, criminal or 
21 administrative enforcement.
22 8. It requires that a Juvenile Court consider any juvenile who requests counsel to be 
23 indigent for the purposes of appointing counsel; authorizes Maine criminal justice agencies 
24 to disseminate confidential juvenile history record information to the commission for the 
25 purposes of assigning, evaluating or supervising counsel; and requires the Juvenile Court, 
26 on request, to disseminate juvenile case records to the commission for the purposes of 
27 assigning, evaluating or supervising counsel.
28 9. It directs the court to appoint new counsel for an indigent parent who appeals from 
29 an order in a child protection proceeding terminating that parent's parental rights; 
30 authorizes the executive director of the commission, or the executive director's designee, 
31 to attend and observe child protection proceedings for purposes related to assigning, 
32 evaluating or supervising counsel; and requires the court and the Department of Health and 
33 Human Services to disclose child protective records to the commission for the purposes of 
34 assigning, evaluating or supervising counsel.
35 10. It prohibits a professional who otherwise qualifies as a mandated reporter of 
36 suspected child abuse or neglect from making a report to the Department of Health and 
37 Human Services if the information that forms the basis of the report would qualify as a 
38 confidence or secret of a covered client of an attorney under the Maine Rules of 
39 Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 and the professional obtained the information while 
40 working for or at the request of the attorney for the covered client, unless the attorney for 
41 the covered client would have the authority to disclose the information under the Maine 
42 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6(b)(1) because the disclosure is reasonably believed 
43 necessary to prevent reasonably certain substantial bodily harm or death.  The bill defines 
44 a "covered client" to mean a parent who is a party to a child protection proceeding or an 
45 adult or minor charged with a crime or a juvenile crime.
