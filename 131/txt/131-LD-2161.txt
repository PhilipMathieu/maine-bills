43 sentencing class.

2SUMMARY
3 This bill clarifies provisions in the Maine Juvenile Code regarding the sealing of 
4 juvenile records by adding a cross-reference and correcting a reference to juvenile history 
5 record information.
6 The bill repeals a provision of law in the Intelligence and Investigative Record 
7 Information Act that contains incorrect terminology and an unnecessary requirement that a 
8 request for a copy of a complaint by a person who made the complaint be made pursuant 
9 to the Freedom of Access Act.
10 The bill also corrects a reference to a repealed statute in a provision in the Maine 
11 Criminal Code regarding sentences of imprisonment by adding the term "former" to the 
12 statutory citation.3
