11 organization of major or minor league baseball teams.
122.  Procedures for application; certificate of approval.  This subsection governs the 
13 procedures for applying for and obtaining a certificate of approval.
14 A.  An applicant may apply to the commissioner for a certificate of approval.  An 
15 applicant shall submit to the commissioner information demonstrating that the 
16 applicant is a qualified applicant. Such information must include an agreement by the 
17 applicant that all employees and subcontractors of the applicant are provided fair 
18 minimum wages and benefits at a rate specified in Title 26, section 1306 or greater.
19 B.  Within 30 days of receipt of an application for a certificate of approval submitted 
20 pursuant to paragraph A, the commissioner shall determine whether the applicant is a 
21 qualified applicant and shall issue either a certificate of approval as a certified applicant 
22 or a written denial indicating why the applicant is not qualified.  A certificate of 
23 approval issued by the commissioner must describe the qualified investment and 
24 specify the total amount of qualified investment approved under the certificate of 
25 approval.
26 C.  A certified applicant shall apply to the commissioner for a certificate of completion.

28 investment, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of completion to the certified 
29 applicant as soon as is practicable.  The certificate of completion must state the amount 
30 of qualified investment made by the certified applicant.  
31 D.  If a certified applicant intends to transfer the qualified professional baseball facility 
32 prior to completion of the qualified investment, the certified applicant must obtain

34 applicant has obtained a certificate of completion, that certificate of completion to the 
35 transferee.  The commissioner shall approve the transfer of the certificate of approval

37 satisfied:
38 (1)  The transferee is a member of the certified applicant's unitary affiliated group 
39 at the time of the transfer; or
40 (2)  The commissioner finds that the transferee will, and has the capacity to, 
41 maintain operations of the qualified professional baseball facility in a manner that 
42 meets the minimum qualifications for continued eligibility for the tax credit under 
43 this section after the transfer occurs.
Page 3 - 131LR2856(01)
1 If the commissioner approves the transfer of the certificate of approval or the certificate 
2 of completion, the transferee, from the date of the transfer, must be treated as the 
3 certified applicant and as eligible to claim any remaining tax credit under the certificate 
4 of approval or the certificate of completion that has not been previously claimed by the 
5 original certified applicant as long as the transferee meets the same eligibility 
6 requirements and conditions for the tax credit as applied to the original certified 
7 applicant. 
83.  Refundable tax credit allowed.  Beginning with the tax year during which a 
9 certificate of completion is issued under subsection 2, paragraph C, a certified applicant is 
10 allowed a credit against the tax due under this Part for the taxable year in an amount equal 
11 to 10% of the certified applicant's qualified investment.  A credit under this section for a 
12 certified applicant may not exceed $100,000 per year and $1,000,000 in cumulative total.
134.  Reporting required.  A certified applicant, the commissioner and the assessor are 
14 required to make reports pursuant to this subsection.
15 A.  On or before March 1st of each year, beginning in 2025, a certified applicant shall 
16 file a report with the commissioner for the tax year ending during the immediately 
17 preceding calendar year, referred to in this subsection as "the report year," containing 
18 the following information:
19 (1) The incremental amount of qualified investment made by the certified applicant 
20 in the report year;

22 on the last day of the report year;
23 (3) The total number of any additional full-time employees in the State added by 
24 the certified applicant since the date a certificate of approval was issued pursuant 
25 to subsection 2, paragraph B and since the last annual report; 
26 (4) The average and median wages of all full-time employees of the certified 
27 applicant; and  
28 (5) The percentage and number of full-time employees of the certified applicant 
29 who have access to retirement benefits and health benefits. 
30 The commissioner may prescribe forms for the annual report described in this 
31 paragraph.  The commissioner shall provide copies of the report to the assessor and to 
32 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation 
33 matters at the time the report is received.
34 B.  On or before April 1st of each year, beginning in 2025, the commissioner shall 
35 report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
36 taxation matters aggregate data on qualified investment amounts of each certified 
37 applicant for each year that the certified applicant claimed a tax credit under this 
38 section.
39 C.  On or before December 31st of each year, beginning in 2025, the assessor shall 
40 report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
41 taxation matters the revenue loss during the report year as a result of this section for 
42 each certified applicant claiming the tax credit and, if necessary, shall include updated 
43 revenue loss amounts for any previous tax year.  For purposes of this paragraph, 
Page 4 - 131LR2856(01)
44 "revenue loss" means the tax credit claimed by the taxpayer and allowed pursuant to 
45 this section, consisting of the amount of the credit used to reduce the tax liability of the 
46 taxpayer and the amount of the credit refunded to the taxpayer, stated separately. 
4 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the reports provided under this 
5 subsection are public records as defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3.
65.  Recapture.  The credit allowed under this section must be fully recaptured to the 
7 extent claimed by the taxpayer if the qualified investment forming the basis of the credit is 
8 not used as a qualified professional baseball facility by the certified applicant or a transferee 
9 approved pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph D for the entire 60-month period following 
10 the qualified investment. The credit must be recaptured by filing an amended return in 
11 accordance with section 5227-A for the tax year in which that qualified investment was 
12 used to calculate the credit under this section. The amended return must reflect the credit 
13 disallowed and the income modifications required by section 5122, subsection 1, paragraph 
14 QQ and section 5200-A, subsection 1, paragraph LL with respect to that facility.
156.  Rules.  The commissioner and the assessor may jointly adopt rules to implement 
16 this section, including, but not limited to, rules for determining and certifying eligibility.  
17 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
18 chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.  
197.  Evaluation.  The tax credit provided under this section is subject to ongoing 
20 legislative review in accordance with Title 3, chapter 37.  In developing evaluation 
21 parameters to perform the review, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
22 Accountability, the joint legislative committee established to oversee program evaluation 
23 and government accountability matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
24 having jurisdiction over taxation matters shall consider:

26 period being reviewed and measures of fiscal impact;
