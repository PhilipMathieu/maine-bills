1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  2 MRSA §9, sub-§6-A, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 411, §1, is amended 
3 to read:
4 E.  Except as provided in paragraph C, ratepayer funds may not be used to implement 
5 the program or to provide funding under the program to distributed solar facilities or 
6 energy storage systems without approval by the Public Utilities Commission. The 
7 commission shall approve the use of ratepayer funds for those purposes if the 
8 commission finds that the use of ratepayer funds is reasonably likely to achieve net 
9 benefits to electric ratepayers.
10Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3408, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 481, §6, is amended

13 375, subchapter 2‑A, to implement this subsection. The Department of Labor may adopt 
14 routine technical rules relating to the Maine emerging industry compensation threshold.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill modifies the Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program established within 
17 the Governor's Energy Office to permit the use of ratepayer funds if the Public Utilities 
18 Commission determines such use of funds is reasonably likely to achieve net benefits to 
19 electric ratepayers. The bill also authorizes the Department of Labor to adopt routine 
20 technical rules relating to the Maine emerging industry compensation threshold in the laws 
21 governing the State's offshore wind initiative.
