Required Activity Unit Affected Local Cost
Requires law enforcement agencies to provide the Department of Public Safety Municipality Moderate
tracking information for each municipality/county where a forensic examination kit County statewide
was entered into the system and complete an inventory of all kits in its possession.
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.
Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $227,222 and a Highway Fund allocation of $122,350 in fiscal year
2024-25 to the Department of Public Safety to establish, operate and maintain a sexual assault forensic examinatio
kit trackmg system, perform an inventory of all kits and develop an annual report on the tracking system.
