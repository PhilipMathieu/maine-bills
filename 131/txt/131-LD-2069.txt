1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA §651, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §92, is 
3 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
4 A.  An applicant shall disclose all ownership interests by a person other than the 
5 applicant equal to or greater than 5% or any direct or indirect interest in the person for 
6 which a license or certificate of approval is sought.  If the applicant is a purchaser by 
7 contract, the applicant shall also disclose the terms of the contract.
8 (1) A business entity that has an ownership interest of 5% or greater in the person 
9 for which a license or certificate of approval is sought shall disclose all subsidiary 
10 business entities and all individuals that have an ownership interest in that business 
11 entity.  
12 (2) A business entity that has an ownership interest of 5% or greater in the person 
13 for which a license or certificate of approval is sought may attest to the bureau via 
14 affidavit that no subsidiary business entity or individual with an ownership interest 
15 in the business entity has an ownership interest of 5% or greater in the person for 
16 which a license or certificate of approval is sought.
17 For purposes of this paragraph, "interest" means full or partial equity ownership interest 
18 or any other type of financial interest or involvement including, but not limited to, 
19 being an investor or serving in a management position.
20Sec. 2.  28-A MRSA §651, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §92, is further 
21 amended to read:
223.  False answer given intentionally.  An applicant may not attempt to conceal or 
23 disguise ownership interest or direct or indirect interest in the person for which a license or 
24 certificate of approval is sought. A person who intentionally gives an untruthful answer in 
25 an application for a license or certificate of approval under this Title violates Title 17‑A, 
26 section 453. As used in this subsection, "interest" has the same meaning as in subsection 2, 
27 paragraph A.
28Sec. 3.  28-A MRSA §651, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
294.  Rulemaking.  The bureau may adopt routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, 
30 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A to administer this section. 
31SUMMARY

33 licenses and certificates of approval to:

36 2.  Require a business entity that has an ownership interest of 5% or greater in a person 
37 for which a license or certificate of approval is sought to disclose all subsidiary business 
38 entities within that business entity and individuals with an ownership interest in the 
39 business entity; and
40 3.  Allow business entities with an ownership interest of 5% or greater in the person

5 of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to adopt routine technical rules if needed
