COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1435, L.D. 2236 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment changes the definition of "eligible 
criminal conviction" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 2261, subsection 6, 
which identifies what is considered an eligible crime for an individual to file a post­
judgment motion to seal criminal history record information related to a conviction for that 
crime, to include crimes committed prior to January 30, 2017 that are no longer considered 
illegal under Maine's adult use cannabis laws.
