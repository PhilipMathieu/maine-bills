COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 1287, L.D. 2007 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill, which 
is a concept draft, and changes the title. Parts A, B, C and D of the amendment amend the 
provisions of An Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, commonly known 
as "the Maine Implementing Act," and the provisions of the Mi'kmaq Nation Restoration 
Act to adopt most of federal Indian law related to the criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts, 
including the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and 
the tribal provisions of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
The amendment affects the jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy Tribal Court, the Penobscot 
Nation Tribal Court and the Houlton Band ofMaliseet Indians Tribal Court as well as the 
potential criminal jurisdiction of the Mi'kmaq Nation Tribal Court, collectively referred to 
in this summary as "the tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations." More specifically, Parts 
A, B, C and D of the amendment: 
1. Recognize the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations 
over Class C, D and E crimes committed within the relevant Wabanaki Nation's respective 
Indian territory or jurisdiction land by an adult member of a federally recognized Indian 
tribe if those crimes: 
A. Are defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, 17, 17-A, 19-A or 29-A and 
are not committed against a person or the property of a person; or 
B. Are defined in any Title of the Maine Revised Statutes and are committed against 
a person or the property of a person who is a member of any federally recognized Indian 
tribe; 
2. Recognize the concurrent jurisdiction of the State and of the tribal courts of the 
Wabanaki Nations over Class C, D and E crimes committed within the relevant Wabanaki 
Nation's respective Indian territory or jurisdiction land: 
A. By an adult member of a federally recognized Indian tribe against a person or the 
property of a person who is not a member of any federally recognized Indian tribe; or 
B. By a person who is not a member of any federally recognized Indian tribe against 
a member of any federally recognized Indian tribe as authorized in the federal Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022. When exercising this concurrent 
criminal jurisdiction, the tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations may not deny to a 
defendant the protections enumerated in 25 United States Code, Sections 1302(a), 
1302(c), 1303 and 1304(d) and all other rights whose protection is necessary under the 
United States Constitution in order for Congress or the State to recognize the tribal 
court's concurrent jurisdiction; 
3. Provide that the tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations may not deny to any criminal 
defendant prosecuted for a Class C crime the rights and protections enumerated in 25 
United States Code, Section l302(c), including the requirement that the judge presiding 
over the criminal proceeding is licensed to practice law and has sufficient legal training; 
the right to the effective assistance of counsel; the right to the appointment of licensed 
counsel at the expense of the tribal government if the defendant is indigent; the right to 
advance notice of all criminal laws and applicable court rnles of the tribal government; and 
the right to have the criminal proceeding recorded;

4. Retain the provisions of current law directing that, when the tribal courts of the 
Wabanaki Nations exercise exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction, the definitions of 
the crimes and the punishments applicable to those crimes are governed by state law but 
clarify that, in doing so, the tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations are nevertheless 
enforcing their respective tribal law. It also retains the provisions of current law directing 
that the provisions of25 United States Code, Sections 1301 to 1303 and rules or regulations

tribal courts of the Wabanaki Nations exercise exclusive or concurrent criminal 
jurisdiction; 
5. Recognize the exclusive jurisdiction of the State over all crimes and juvenile crimes 
not within the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the tribal courts of the Wabanaki 
Nations that are committed on Indian territory or jurisdiction land, including: 
A. Notwithstanding any provision oflaw to the contrary, all crimes and juvenile crimes 
against the State or any office, department, agency, authority, commission, board, 
institution, hospital or other instrumentality of the State; and 
B. All Class C, D and E crimes defined in provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes 
outside of Titles 15, 17, 17-A, 19-A and 29-A committed by an adult member of any 
federally recognized Indian tribe that are not committed against a person or the property 
of a person; and 
6. Clarify that nothing within the Maine Implementing Act or the Mi'kmaq Nation 
Restoration Act affects, alters or preempts the authority of the State to investigate or 
prosecute any conduct occurring on Indian territory or trust land that is within the State's 
exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. 
Part B of the amendment also amends the provisions of the Maine Implementing Act 
governing the jurisdictional relationship between the State and the Penobscot Nation that 
were included within Part C of Public Law 2023, chapter 369, but that were not approved 
by the Penobscot Nation within the time frame established in Part C, section 6 of that law. 
These provisions of Part B of the amendment: 
1. Recognize the exclusive authority of the Penobscot Nation in Penobscot Indian 
territory to enact ordinances regulating drinking water unless the nation exercises its 
discretion to enter into an intergovernmental agreement authorizing the State to exercise 
concurrent jurisdiction over specific drinking water-related issues. It also prohibits the 
State from exercising primary enforcement authority to implement the federal Safe 
Drinking Water Act within Penobscot Indian territory and recognizes the authority of the 
Penobscot Nation to seek to be treated as a state and to obtain primary enforcement 
authority to implement the federal Safe Drinking Water Act within Penobscot Indian 
territory; 
2. Provide that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court over 
certain criminal offenses, juvenile crimes, small claims and civil drug possession actions 
arising within the Penobscot Indian reservation under current law extends to those same 
types of criminal offenses, juvenile crimes, small claims and civil drug possession actions 
arising within all of Penobscot Indian territory. To the extent that the Penobscot Nation 
Tribal Court has exclusive jurisdiction over members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the 
Penobscot Nation under these provisions, it extends that exclusive jurisdiction to members 
of any of the Wabanaki Nations. It also provides that the exclusive jurisdiction of the
