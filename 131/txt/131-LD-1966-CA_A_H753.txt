Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill allows candidates for the office of district attorney to participate in the Maine Clean Elections program
beginning in the 2026 election cycle. The Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices has indicated
that funding to these additional candidates will require additional expenditures from the Maine Clean Election Fund of
$25,500 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $479,600 in fiscal year 2026-27. The Commission has also indicated an estimated
one-time cost of $5,000 in fiscal year 2025-26 to upgrade the electronic qualifying contributions system to incorporate
the new candidates,
Increasing the number of potential candidates who use the Maine Clean Elections program may mean expenditures
from the program will exceed what is available in the fund and additional legislation will be required to increase the
annual transfer from the General Fund.
