 Section 24.  Reapportionment.  Congressional districts must be reapportioned as

 1.  Procedure.   Beginning in 2021 and every 10 years thereafter, when the 
Secretary of State has received notification of the number of congressional seats to which 
the State is entitled and the Federal Decennial Census population count is final, the 
Legislative Apportionment Commission, established every 10 years pursuant to Article IV, 
Part Third, Section 1-A, shall review the existing congressional districts.  If the districts do 
not conform to Supreme Judicial Court guidelines, the commission shall reapportion the 
State into congressional districts.  
 
 In making such a reapportionment, the commission shall ensure th at each 
congressional district is formed of compact and contiguous territory and crosses political 
subdivisions the least number of times necessary to establish districts as equally populated 
as possible.   The commission shall submit its plan to the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives no later than June 1st of the year in which apportionment is required. The 
Legislature shall enact the submitted plan of the commission or a plan of its own in regular 
or special session by a vote of 2/3 of the members of each House by June 11th of the year 
in which apportionment is required to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. This 
CONSTITUTION OF MAINE

following the period in which the Legislature is required to act but fails to do so. In making 
the apportionment, the S upreme Judicial Court shall take into consideration plans and 
briefs filed by the public with the court during the first 30 days of the period in which the 
court is required to apportion. 
 
 3.  Judicial review.   The Supreme Judicial Court has original juri sdiction to hear 
any challenge to an apportionment law enacted by the Legislature, as registered by any 
citizen or group of citizens. If a challenge is sustained, the Supreme Judicial Court shall 
make the apportionment. 
 
 Section 25.   Apportionment of coun ty commissioner districts.   County 
commissioner districts must be apportioned as follows.  
 
 1.  Redistricting, generally.  Beginning in 2021 and every 10 years thereafter, the 
apportionment commission established under Article IV, Part Third, Section 1 -A shall 
review the existing county commissioner districts and, as necessary, reapportion those 
districts in each county to establish as nearly as practicable equally populated districts. The 
Speaker of the House of Representatives is responsible for calling the commission together 
to review the county commissioner districts.   No action may be taken by the commission 
without a quorum of 7. 
A.  The apportionment commission shall divide the number of commissioners in 
each county into the number of inhabitants of the county, excluding foreigners not 
naturalized, according to the latest Federal Decennial Census or a state census 
previously ordered by the Legislature to coincide with the Federal Decennial 
Census, to determine a mean population figure for each county  commissioner 
district.  Each county commissioner district must be formed of contiguous and 
compact territory and must cross political subdivision lines the least number of 
times necessary to establish as nearly as practicable equally populated districts. 
Whenever the population of a municipality entitles it to more than one district, all 
whole districts must be drawn within the municipal boundaries.   Any population 
remainder within the municipality must be included in a district drawn to cross the 
municipal boundary as long as the population remainder within the municipality is 
contiguous to another municipality or municipalities included in the district.   Any 
county that already meets the standards and guidelines for equally populated 
districts, as established by this section, this Constitution and the Constitution of the 
United States, need not be reapportioned. 
 
CONSTITUTION OF MAINE 
43

commission to consider.  Those plans must be submitted to the commission no later

House of Representatives under this subsection.  The commission may hold public 
hearings on plans affecting each county. 
 
C.  The commission shall submit it s plan to the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives no later than June 1st of the year in which apportionment is 
required.  The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall submit to the Legislature, 
no later than January 15, 2022, and every 10th year there after, one legislative 
document to reapportion the county commissioner districts based on the plan 
submitted by the apportionment commission.   The Legislature must enact the 
submitted plan or a plan of its own in regular or special session by a vote of 2/3 of 
the members of each House within 30 calendar days after the plan is submitted to 
it by the Clerk of the House of Representatives.   This action is subject to the 
Governor's approval, as provided in Article IV, Part Third, Section 2. 
 
 2.  Supreme Judici al Court.  If the Legislature fails to make an apportionment 
within the 30 calendar days, the Supreme Judicial Court shall make the apportionment 
within 60 calendar days following the period in which the Legislature is required to act but

amended, under appropriate titles and in proper articles, parts and sections, omit ting all

language thereof, and shall submit the same to the Legislature; and such arrangement of

with the amendments made thereto, in accordance with the provisions thereof, shall be the 
supreme law of the State. 
 
 Section 7.  Original sections 1, 2, 5, of Article X not to be printed; section 5 in 
full force.  (Repealed) 
________________ 
 
2024 REARRANGEMENT NOTES 
of Chief Justice Valerie Stanfill 
 
Article X, section 7 was repealed by Const. Res. 2023, ch. 1, passed in 2023. As a 
result, sections 1, 2 and 5 of article X may be printed. Under article X, section 6 of the 
Maine Constitution, however, in arranging the Constitution to be printed the Chief 
Justice is required to omit “all sections, clauses and wo rds not in force.” Upon review 
of sections 1 and 2 for inclusion in the printing, it is patently clear on the face of each 
section that neither remains in force. They both pertain only to the first Legislature, 
which has long since adjourned. As a result, sections 1 and 2 have been omitted from 
article X.  
Section 5 is incorporated in this rearrangement because it is not evident from the 
plain text of this section that it is not in force. Section 5 of article X was also previously 
not printed pursuant to th e now -repealed seventh section of article X. There are 
multiple versions of section 5 in existence before the 1875 passage of section 7, see 
Resolves 1875, ch. 98, approved in 1875, although the differences appear non -
substantive. This arrangement incorpor ates the iteration of section 5 that appeared in 
the last officially published version of the Maine Constitution before the section was 
ordered not to be printed. See R.S. (1871) at 42-46.* 
 
* Revisor's Note: The last officially published version of Articl e X, Section 5 in 
1875 contained many transcription errors, most of them nonsubstantive.  Since there 
were no intervening amendments to Article X, Section 5 from the date of its approval 
as part of the Constitution of Maine in 1820 to when it was last published in 1871, the 
version of Article X, Section 5 that appears in this document is the 1820 version.
