are manifestly unfounded. excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the 
consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the 
request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of 
demonstrating the manifestly unfounded. excessive or repetitive nature of the request. 
D. If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise a right afforded under 
subsection 1 using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is not required to 
comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide 
notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to 
exercise the right until the consumer provides additional information reasonably 
necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request to exercise the right. 
A controller is not required to authenticate an opt-out request, but a controller may 
deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable and documented 
belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because 
the controller believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send a notice to the 
person who made the request disclosing that the controller believes the request is 
fraudulent, explaining why the controller believes the request is fraudulent and 
explaining that the controller will not comply with the request. 
E. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other 
than the consumer is in compliance with a consumer's request to delete that data 
pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph C by: 
(1) Retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for 
the purpose of ensuring that the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the 
controller's records and not using the retained data for any other purpose pursuant 
to the provisions of this chapter: or 
(2) Opting the consumer out of the processing of the personal data obtained from 
a source other than the consumer for any purpose except for any purpose exempt 
from the restrictions of this chapter under section 9611.

the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of 
action taken or not taken in response to the appeal. including a written explanation of the 
reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the 
consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the 
consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.

goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the 
consumer. 
4. Loyalty and rewards programs. A controller may offer a different price, rate, 
level. quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or 
services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation 
in a bona fide loyalty. rewards. premium features, discounts or club card program. 
5. Privacy notice, A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and 
meaningful privacy notice in plain language that is understandable by a reasonable 
consumer that includes: 
A. The categories of personal data processed by the controller: 
B. The purpose for processing personal data; 
C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer 
may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request:

consumer affected by the material change and to provide each affected consumer with a 
reasonable opportunity to withdraw consent for the materially different processing of the 
consumer's previously collected personal data. 
7, Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall 
describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit 
a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure 
and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact 
with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the 
ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A 
controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a 
consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing. The disclosure 
required under this section must include: 
A. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Do Not Sell My Personal Data" or bearing a 
substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs the 
consumer. or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables 
the consumer. or an agent of the consumer. to opt out of the sale of the consumer's 
personal data; and 
B. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Opt Me Out of Targeted Advertising" or bearing 
a substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs 
the consumer. or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables 
the consumer. or an agent of the consumer. to opt out of processing of the consumer's 
personal data for targeted advertising. 
In lieu of providing the 2 links described in paragraphs A and B. a controller may satisfy 
the requirements of this subsection by providing a single conspicuous and clearly labeled 
link on the controller's publicly accessible website that allows a consumer, or an agent of 
the consumer. both to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal data and to opt out of 
the processing of the consumer's personal data for targeted advertising. If the controller 
maintains a specific section or page of its publicly accessible website that allows a 
consumer, or an agent of the consumer. to opt out of the sale of the consumer's data or the 
processing of the consumer's data for targeted advertising and to select additional privacy 
controls, the controller may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by providing a single

sent. with the consumer's consent. by a platform. technology or mechanism to the controller 
indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. The platform. 
technology or mechanism: 
A. Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer; 
B. May not unfairly disadvantage another controller; 
C. May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to make an 
affirmative. freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any such processing or 
sale of the consumer's personal data; 
D. Must be as consistent as possible with another similar platform. technology or 
mechanism required by federal or state law; and 
E. Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a 
resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt 
out of the sale of the consumer's personal data or targeted advertising. 
A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the 
laws of another state is in compliance with this subsection.

§9607. Responsibilities of processors and controllers 
1. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a 
controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this 
chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include: 
A. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures. so far as is reasonably 
practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request: 
B. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation 
to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a 
breach of security. as defined in chapter 210-B. of the zystem of the processor. in order 
to meet the controller's obligations: and 
C. Providing necessary inf01mation to enable the controller to conduct and document 
data protection assessments. 
2. Contractual requirements. A contract between a controller and a processor must 
govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on 
behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data. 
the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing. the duration of 
processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must require that the 
processor: 
A. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of 
confidentiality with respect to the data: 
B. At the controller's direction. delete or return all personal data to the controller as 
requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data 
is required by law: 
C. On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all 
information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's 
compliance with the obligations in this chapter: 
D. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the 
controller's designated assessor. The processor may arrange for a qualified and 
independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical 
and organizational measures in support of the obligations in this chapter. using an 
appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for

E. Provide the controller an opportunity to object before engaging a subcontractor and. 
if no obiection is made. engage the subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that 
requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the 
personal data. 
3. Processing relationship liability. Nothing in this section may be construed to 
relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor 
by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described 
in this chapter. 
4. Fact-based determination. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller 
or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that 
depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not 
limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions. or 
who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a 
specific processing of data, A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's 
instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a 
processor begins, alone or iointly with other persons, determining the purposes and means 
of the processing of personal data. the processor acts as a controller with respect to the 
processing and may be subiect to an enforcement action under section 9612. 
5, Data security and deletion. Controllers and processors shall establish, implement 
and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices to 
protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the 
volume and nature of the personal data. These processes must include the disposal of 
personal data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires: 
A. The disposal of personal data by the controller when the data is required to be 
deleted by law or when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which the 
data was processed unless the consumer has consented to the retention of the data for 
a longer period of time or retention of the data is required by law: and 
B. The disposal of personal data by the processor or return of that personal data to the 
controller as requested at the end of the processor's provision of services to the 
controller unless retention of the data is required by law. 
For purposes of this subsection, "disposal of personal data" means the destruction or 
permanent deletion of the data or other modification of the data to make the data unreadable 
or indecipherable and unrecoverable. 
6. Consent required to transfer sensitive data. Controllers and processors may not 
transfer sensitive data to a 3rd party unless the consumer consents to the transfer. 
7, Discrimination prohibited. Controllers and processors may not, unless it is 
necessary to comply with other applicable law, process personal data in a manner that 
discriminates against individuals. or otherwise makes unavailable the equal enioyment of 
the controller's or processor's goods or services, on the basis of an individual's actual or 
perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, physical or mental 
disability, religion, ancestty, national origin. age or familial status. This subsection does 
not apply to:

A. The processing of personal data by a controller or processor for the purpose of self­
testing to prevent or mitigate unlawful discrimination or for the purpose of diversifying 
an applicant, participant or customer pool; or 
(1) A private establishment described in 42 United States Code, Section 2000a(e). 
For purposes of this subsection, "familial status," "gender identity," "physical or mental 
disability," and "sexual orientation," have the same meanings as in Title 5, section 4553, 
subsections 5-A, 5-C, 7-A and 9-C, respectively. For purposes of this subsection, "sex" 
has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 4572-A, subsection 1. 
§9608. Data protection assessments 
1. Documentation. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection 
assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk 
of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, "processing that presents a 
heightened risk of harm to a consumer" includes: 
A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; 
· B. The sale of personal data; 
C. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling 
presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of: 
(1) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers; 
(2) Financial. physical or reputational injury to consumers; 
(3) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private 
affairs or concerns, of consumers. when the intrusion would be offensive to a 
reasonable person; or 
( 4) Other substantial injury to consumers; and 
D. The processing of sensitive data. 
2. Required elements. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection 
1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly. from the 
processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the 
potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing. as mitigated by 
safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall 
factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable 
expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship 
between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed. 
3. Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records. The Attorney 
General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant 
to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. and the controller shall make the 
data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may 
evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in 
this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under 
Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment 
disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege 
or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of that privilege or 
protection.

reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would 
otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section. 
6. Deadline for performing data protection assessments. A controller shall conduct 
and document a data protection assessment as required by this section: 
A. Within 6 months of the date that the controller first engages in a processing activity

B. Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or 
technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request

controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the 
controller:

would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the 
personal data; and 
B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the 
subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data 
about the same consumer.

any facility that provides in-person health care services for the purpose of identifying, 
tracking, collecting data from or sending any notification regarding the consumer's

G. To present an advertisement. including targeted advertising, to an individual or 
device via a method that includes, but is not limited to, a website or application, direct

complies with the prohibition against using the personal data of a minor for targeted 
advertising under section 9606, subsection 3, paragraph A and the personal data 
processed for the advertisement does not include sensitive data. 
3, Evidentiary privilege, The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under 
this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor 
would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. Nothing in this chapter 
may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data 
concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of 
this State as part of a privileged communication. 
4. Private schools, The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this 
chapter do not prohibit a private school that is not subject to the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act of 1974. 20 United States Code, Section 1232g et seq .. from denying a 
consumer's request to delete the consumer's personal data if the deletion of that personal 
data would unreasonably interfere with the provision of educational services by the school 
or would unreasonably interfere with the ordinary operation of the school. For pm:poses of 
this subsection. "private school" has the same meaning as in Title 20-A, section 1. 
subsection 22. 
5. Liability, A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or 
3rd-party controller in accordance with this chapter has not violated this chapter if the 
processor or 3rd-party controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this 
chapter. as long as. at the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal 
data. the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the receiving 
processor or 3rd-party controller would violate this chapter. A 3rd-party controller or 
processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with this 
chapter is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or 
processor from which the 3rd-party controller or processor receives the personal data. 
6. Exemptions. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to: 
A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights 
or freedoms of a person. including, but not limited to, the rights of a person: 
(1) To freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the United States

(2) Under Title 16. section 61; or 
B. Apply to an individual's processing of personal data in the course of the individual's 
purely personal or household activities.

section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:

exemption in this section. the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the 
processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 7. 
9, Clarification of roles. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly 
identified in this section does not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to the 
processing.

SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
enacts the Maine Data Privacy and Protection Act, which takes effect July 1, 2025. The 
Act regulates the collection, use, processing, transfer, sale and deletion of nonpublicly 
available personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual who is a 
resident of this State or to a device that is reasonably linkable to an individual who is a 
resident of this State, referred to in the Act as a 11 consumer," by a person that conducts 
business in this State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, 
referred to in the Act as a "controller." Under the Act, a controller must limit the collection 
and processing of personal data to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to 
provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer, except that 
the controller must limit the collection and processing of certain sensitive data to what is 
strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the 
consumer. Under the Act, "sensitive data" includes data revealing the consumer's race or 
ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, citizenship or immigration status; genetic or biometric data; 
precise geolocation data; social security, driver's license or nondriver identification card 
numbers; specific financial or account access information; data of a known minor; or data

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 1270, L.D, 1977 
concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime. A controller is also required to 
obtain a consumer's affirmative consent before collecting any biometric data. If the 
controller knows that the consumer has not attained 13 years of age, the controller may not 
process the consumer's data for any purpose without parental consent. If the controller 
knows or willfully disregards that the consumer is a minor, the controller may not process 
the consumer's data for targeted advertising in any circumstances and must obtain consent 
before processing the consumer's data for sale. 
The Act requires a controller to provide consumers with a privacy notice specifying 
the categories of personal data processed by the controller, the purposes for processing the 
personal data, the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties and the categories 
of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. A consumer has the right, under the Act, 
to confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data; to require the 
controller to correct inaccuracies in or delete the consumer's personal data; to obtain a copy 
.of the consumer's personal data; and to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal 
data for purposes of targeted advertising, sale or profiling in furtherance of decisions about 
the consumer's access to financial or lending services, housing, insurance, education, 
criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care services and essential goods and 
services. The privacy notice must describe how a consumer may exercise these rights. A 
controller is also required to notify each affected consumer before implementing a material 
change for previously collected personal data with respect to any items described in the 
privacy notice. 
The Act prohibits a controller from processing data in a manner that discriminates 
against a person in violation of state or federal law. A controller is also prohibited from 
retaliating against a consumer for exercising the consumer's rights under the Act, except 
that a controller may offer different prices or selection of goods in connection with a 
consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty or discount program. A controller 
and any person that processes data for the controller, must establish, implement and 
maintain reasonable data security practices and a retention schedule that requires the 
disposal of personal data by the controller when deletion is required by law or the data is 
no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed unless retention of the data 
is required by law. The retention schedule must also require the disposal of data by or the 
return of the data to the controller by a person who processes data for the controller, unless 
retention of the data is required by law. If a controller engages in a data processing activity 
that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer, including processing any data for 
targeted advertising, sale or profiling or any processing of sensitive data, the controller 
must conduct and document a data protection assessment within 6 months of the effective 
date of the Act to identify and weigh the benefits and potential risks of the processing 
activity. After the effective date of the Act, a controller must also conduct a data protection 
assessment within 6 months of making a material change to an existing processing activity 
or initiating a new processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. 
The controller may be required to disclose the data protection assessment to the Attorney 
General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is relevant to an investigation 
conducted by the Attorney General. The Act further prohibits any person from establishing 
a geofence within 1,750 feet of any in-person health care facility in the State, other than 
the operator of the facility, for the purpose of identifying, tracking, collecting data from or 
sending a notification regarding consumer health data to consumers who enter that area.

that both processed the personal data of fewer than 10,000 consumers in the preceding 
calendar year and derived no more than 20% of gross revenue from the sale of personal

for purposes other than completing payment transactions of fe,yer than 100,000 consumers 
in the preceding calendar year, except that, beginning January 1, 2027, this exception 
applies only to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other

25 regarding an applicant for employment or employee to the extent the data is collected and 
26 used within the context of that rnle; and data necessary for the controller to administer

28 from engaging in specifically enumerated activities, including complying with Maine or 
29 federal law; complying with investigations or subpoenas from govenm1ental authorities, 
30 including the Federal Government and the government of the State or a federally 
31 recognized Indian tribe in the State; cooperating with federal, tribal or Maine law

3 5 adve1tisement to a consumer, for example a prnduct survey; transferring assets to a 3rd 
36 patty in the context of a merger or similar transaction if certain notice requirements are 
3 7 met; transferring passwords if necessary for use of a password manager; and transferring 
3 8 genetic information if necessaiy to conduct medical research or provide medical treatment 
39 specifically requested by the consumer. The Act also does not prnhibit a controller from 
40 using personal data collected in a lawful manner: for internal product research; to effectuate 
41 a product recall; in a manner consistent with a consumer's reasonable expectations or for a
