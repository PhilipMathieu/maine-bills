requirements for targeted case management services for adults with substance use disorder 
the provision regarding pregnancy, living with minor children and intravenous drug use. 
It removes from Committee Amendment "A" Part TTTT, which required the 
Department of Health and Human Services to extend supplemental payments to the Maine 
Veterans' Homes. 
It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish reimbursement 
rates for Maine Veterans' Homes services covered by the MaineCare program. It requires 
the MaineCare program to reimburse veterans' facilities for covered services on a per 
resident daily rate basis that will reimburse the portion of the total MaineCare allowable 
cost of operating each veterans' facility attributable to the provision of services to residents 
who receive MaineCare benefits. This Part requires the department to index the rates to 
inflation annually. It also requires the Maine Health Data Organization to submit a report 
regarding implementing a uniform data collection and reporting system on the State's so­
called care gap related to MaineCare and state-funded services. 
It amends Public Law 2023, chapter 406, which funded collective bargaining 
agreements with executive branch employees for the fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25, by 
removing the cap on the amount that may be used to fund the Salary Plan program and 
instead allowing the funds to be provided pursuant to agreements with collective bargaining 
agents for executive branch bargaining units instead of pursuant to a collective bargaining 
agreement. 
It amends the recruitment and retention adjustment process for state civil service 
employees by: 
1. Reducing from 4 to at least 2 the number of specified conditions that must be met to 
authorize payment of a recruitment and retention adjustment; and 
2. Requiring, in the event the committee formed to determine the appropriate 
recruitment and retention adjustments cannot agree on the appropriate adjustment, the use 
of a neutral 3rd party to make a final decision. 
It provides that, beginning in the school year starting after June 30, 2025, the minimum 
hourly wage for educational technicians is 125% of the state minimum hourly wage and 
the minimum hourly wage for other school support staff who are paid hourly is 112.5% of 
the state minimum hourly wage. If the state minimum hourly wage is increased on January 
1st of any year, the minimum hourly wage for educational technicians and other school 
support staff is increased beginning July 1st of the same year. It provides that, beginning 
in fiscal year 2025-26 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner of Education 
is required to update the salary matrix to reflect any increase in the minimum hourly wage 
of educational technicians and other school support staff. The Department of Education is 
directed to incorporate the minimum hourly wage into the essential programs and services 
funding model. It also provides that the State must pay 100% of the additional funding 
necessary to achieve the minimum hourly wage.
