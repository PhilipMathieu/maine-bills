36SUMMARY

41 licensing system and registry. This bill also repeals the provision of law that grants specific 
42 authority to the administrator to establish, by rulemaking, requirements that certain 
43 background checks be required to obtain a payroll processor license. However, the bill does 
44 not remove the general authority of the administrator to adopt rules establishing 
45 requirements for licensing of payroll processors.
