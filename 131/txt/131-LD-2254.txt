Page 1 - 131LR3104(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, legislation was enacted during the First Special Session of the 131st 
4 Legislature amending the laws governing political expenditures, lobbying expenditures, 
5 trade association contributions and educational expenditures made by a public utility or an 
6 affiliated interest; and
7Whereas, the new provisions of law include exemptions for consumer-owned water 
8 utilities related to educational expenditures and trade association contributions but not for 
9 lobbying expenditures or certain local referendum election expenditures; and
10Whereas, the Public Utilities Commission is currently engaging in rulemaking that 
11 will include interpreting the new laws; however, rulemaking will not be completed before 
12 adjournment of the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature; and
13Whereas, the Public Utilities Commission, through the rule-making process, could 
14 interpret the new laws to effectively prohibit or significantly limit a consumer-owned water 
15 utility from engaging in lobbying activities or activities necessary to finance legally 
16 required trustee elections or referendum elections and notify the public about those 
17 elections; and
18Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, it is important to clarify these new laws 
19 with respect to consumer-owned water utilities during the Second Regular Session of the 
20 131st Legislature and for the changes to take effect earlier than 90 days after the date of 
21 adjournment; and
22Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
23 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
24 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
25 therefore,
26Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
27Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §302, sub-§2, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 286, §1, is 
28 amended to read:
29 A.  Contributions or gifts to political candidates, political parties, political or legislative 
30 committees or any committee or organization working to influence referendum 
31 petitions or elections.  Nothing in this paragraph prohibits a consumer-owned water 
32 utility from undertaking expenditures related to notifying the public of or conducting 
33 trustee elections or local referendum elections directly related to or legally required for 
34 the operation of a consumer-owned water utility;
35Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §302, sub-§2, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 286, §1, is 
36 amended to read:
37 C.  Expenditures for lobbying or grassroots lobbying.  This paragraph does not apply 
38 to a consumer-owned water utility; and
39Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
40 takes effect when approved.
