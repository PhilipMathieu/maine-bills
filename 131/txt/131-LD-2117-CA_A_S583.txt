Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment ''/t,(S"5~~ 
Committee: Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
4 year licenses changed to annual 
No net change to revenue over time 
This bill changes the license term for certain sports betting-related licenses from a 4-year term to a 1-year tenn and 
reduces the associated license fee by a proportional amount. Over time, the net impact on General Fund revenue from 
these changes will be zero as the revenue received shifts from once every 4 years to yearly with the annual renewals. 
Since the Gambling Control Unit issued all current licenses in the current fiscal year (2023-24) and doesn't anticipate 
any new licenses, the changed tenns and fees will not impact anticipated revenues until fiscal year 2027-28.
