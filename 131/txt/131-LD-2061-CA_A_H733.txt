Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) within the Department of Agriculture,
Conservation and Forestry to convey 32 acres known as Peacock Beach State Park to the Town of Richmond by
quitclaim deed. The land has been included in a nonrevenue-generating lease between the BPL and the town since
2011. The town has used revenue collected at the beach to support the use of the beach. Since this land was originally
obtained using federal funding, the transfer is subject to certain terms and conditions requiring the land to be
maintained for its current noncommercial recreational use in perpetuity and the State retains the right of first refusal
regarding future conveyances of the property.
