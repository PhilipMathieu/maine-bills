The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $266,000 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment will make the provisions of the bill contingent upon approval by the voters at a referendum. Because 
this vote will not occur until November 2024 and the Gambling Control Unit will delay rulemaking until after the 
referendum, appropriations and allocations are removed from fiscal year 2024-25 and any revenue impact will be 
delayed until fiscal year 2025-2026, contingent on the referendum results.
