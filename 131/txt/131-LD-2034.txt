34SUMMARY
35 This bill amends the laws governing erosion control to extend the requirement for 
36 preventing unreasonable erosion of soil or sediment statewide instead of applying only in 
37 the organized areas of the State.  The bill does not extend the application of the retroactive 
38 provisions of the laws regarding erosion because of human activity, which currently apply 
39 only in the organized areas of the State, to the unorganized areas of the State.
40 The bill also clarifies that the Maine Land Use Planning Commission and the 
41 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Forestry have 
42 enforcement authority pursuant to their delegated authority under the Natural Resources 
43 Protection Act.35
