6 soil or other earthen materials shall take measures in accordance with the dates established 
7 under this paragraph to prevent unreasonable erosion of soil or sediment into a protected 
8 natural resource as defined in section 480‑B, subsection 8.  Adequate and timely temporary 
9 and permanent stabilization measures must be taken and maintained on that site to prevent 
10 unreasonable erosion and sedimentation.  This paragraph applies on and after July 1, 2005 
11 to property that is located in the watershed of a body of water most at risk as identified in 
12 the department's storm water rules adopted pursuant to section 420‑D and that is subject to 
13 erosion of soil or sediment into a protected natural resource as defined in section 480‑B, 
14 subsection 8.  This paragraph applies on and after July 1, 2010 to other property that is

27Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §480-R, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2003, c. 414, Pt. B, §71 and

34SUMMARY
35 This bill amends the laws governing erosion control to extend the requirement for 
36 preventing unreasonable erosion of soil or sediment statewide instead of applying only in 
37 the organized areas of the State.  The bill does not extend the application of the retroactive 
38 provisions of the laws regarding erosion because of human activity, which currently apply 
39 only in the organized areas of the State, to the unorganized areas of the State.
40 The bill also clarifies that the Maine Land Use Planning Commission and the 
41 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Forestry have 
42 enforcement authority pursuant to their delegated authority under the Natural Resources 
43 Protection Act.
