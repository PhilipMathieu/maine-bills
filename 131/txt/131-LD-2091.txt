11 business or a 3rd party, in accordance with any applicable national or global standards for 
12 health and safety. The department shall provide technical assistance and education to 
13 business owners and consumers regarding best practices for the use of returnable, reusable  
14 or refillable containers.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill amends the food policy laws governing reusable containers, which ensure the 
17 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's rules do not preclude business 
18 owners from allowing consumers to supply their own containers for the bulk purchase of 
19 shelf-stable food and nonfood items, to ensure instead that the rules do not preclude 
20 business owners from allowing consumers to supply their own containers for the purchase 
21 of food, beverage and nonfood items.  It also requires the department to ensure that rules 
22 explicitly allow a business owner to sell the business's products to consumers in the State 
23 in returnable, reusable or refillable containers and packaging supplied by the business 
24 owner or a 3rd party in accordance with applicable national or global health and safety 
25 standards.
