1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  10 MRSA §1499-B, sub-§1, ¶D-2 is enacted to read:
3 D-2.  "Reassigned numbers database" means a database created and maintained by the 
4 Federal Communications Commission that identifies whether a telephone number has 
5 been reassigned.
6Sec. 2.  10 MRSA §1499-B, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2007, c. 489, §3, is further 
7 amended to read:
86.  Telephone solicitation violations.  It is a violation of this section for a telephone 
9 solicitor to initiate a telephone sales call to a consumer if that consumer's telephone number 
10 has been on the national or state do-not-call registry, established by the Federal Trade 
11 Commission, for at least 3 months prior to the date the call is made or to fail to use the 
12 reassigned numbers database to verify that a consumer's telephone number has not been 
13 reassigned prior to initiating a telephone sales call to that consumer. A telephone solicitor 
14 is not liable for violating this section if the telephone solicitor can demonstrate that:
15 A.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone solicitor 
16 has established and implemented written procedures to comply with this section;
17 B.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone solicitor 
18 has trained its personnel, and any entity assisting in its compliance, in the procedures 
19 established pursuant to paragraph A;
20 C.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone solicitor 
21 or another person acting on behalf of the telephone solicitor has recorded and 
22 maintained a list of telephone numbers the telephone solicitor may not contact;
23 D.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone solicitor 
24 uses a process to prevent telemarketing to any telephone number on any list established 
25 pursuant to paragraph C or on the national do-not-call registry, employing a version of 
26 the national do-not-call registry obtained from the Federal Trade Commission no more 
27 than 31 days prior to the date any call is made, and maintains records documenting this 
28 process;
29 E.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone solicitor 
30 or another person acting on behalf of the telephone solicitor monitors and enforces 
31 compliance with the procedures established pursuant to paragraph A; and
32 E-1.  As part of the telephone solicitor's routine business practice, the telephone 
33 solicitor or another person acting on behalf of the telephone solicitor uses the 
34 reassigned numbers database to verify that a consumer's telephone number has not been 
35 reassigned prior to initiating a telephone sales call to that consumer; and
36 F.  Any subsequent call otherwise violating this section is the result of error.
