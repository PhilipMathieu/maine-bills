Fiscal Detail and Notes
Beginning January 1, 2025, this bill increases the portion of the fees paid when registering watercraft for operating on
the inland waters of the State from $15 to $25 for invasive species prevention and control. The bill also increases the
fee paid for lake and river protection stickers required for nonresident motorboats, personal watercraft and seaplanes
operating on inland waters of the State from $45 to $60. Beginning January 1, 2028, these fees increase from $25 to
$35 for resident and from $60 to $75 for nonresidents. The bill also changes references m statute so that all revenues
from the sale of lake and river protection stickers are divided 70% to the Invasive Aquatic Plant and Nuisance Species
Fund within the Departi-cient of Environmental Protection (DEP) and 30% to the Lake and River Protection Fund
within the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW),
The increased invasive species prevention and control fees will generate revenue of $533,345 for the IFW and
$628,342 for the DEP for the fiscal years 2024-25 through 2026-27. These amounts will increase again as the new
higher prices come into effect in fiscal year 2027-28. This estimate was generated by using the average number of
registrations and annual revenues to both funds, The bill includes allocations of those amounts to the IFW and the
DEP to allow expenditure of the additional revenue.
