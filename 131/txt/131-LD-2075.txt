Page 1 - 131LR2789(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, health care workers who are exposed to bodily fluids from patients are at 
4 high risk of infection; and
5Whereas, it is imperative that appropriate treatment following exposure be started as 
6 soon as possible, which requires knowledge of the pathogen to which the health care worker 
7 may have been exposed; and
8Whereas, this legislation allows for a more rapid determination of whether a patient 
9 may be positive for HIV and is necessary as quickly as possible to protect the health care 
10 workers in the State; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §19203-A, sub-§4-A, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 429, §3, is 
17 amended to read:
184-A.  Occupational exposure in health care setting.  When a bona fide occupational 
19 exposure occurs in a health care setting, a legal representative or administrator of that health 
20 care setting shall seek authorization to test the source patient for HIV must be obtained 
21 from that patient if the patient is present or can be contacted at the time of exposure and is 
22 capable of providing consent.  At the time of exposure, if the source patient is not present 
23 and can not  cannot be contacted or is incapacitated, then any reasonably available member  
24 of the following classes of individuals who is present, in descending order of priority, may 
25 authorize an HIV test on a blood or tissue sample from the source patient:
26 A.  The patient's legal guardian;
27 B.  An individual known to have power of attorney for health care for the patient;
28 C.  An adult relative, by blood, marriage or adoption;
29 D.  An adult with whom the patient has a meaningful social and emotional relationship; 
30 and
31 E.  A physician who is familiar with occupational exposures to HIV.
32 The individual authorizing the HIV test must be informed of the nature, reliability and 
33 significance of the HIV test and the confidential nature of the test.
34 If the person contacted for authorization explicitly refuses to authorize the test, the test may 
35 not be conducted unless consent is obtained from the source patient or from the court 
36 pursuant to section 19203‑C.
37 This subsection does not authorize a person described in paragraphs A to D to receive the 
38 test result.  Test results must be given to the exposed person, to a personal physician if 
39 designated by the exposed person and to either the physician who authorizes the test or the 
40 health care provider who manages the occupational exposure.
Page 2 - 131LR2789(01)1 The patient may choose not to be informed about the result of the HIV test.  Without express 
2 patient authorization, the results of the HIV test and the fact that an HIV test was done as 
3 a result of an occupational exposure in a health care setting may not appear in the patient's 
4 health care records.  The exposed individual's occupational health care record may include 
5 documentation of the occupational exposure and, if the record does not reveal the source 
6 patient's identity, the results of the source patient's HIV test.
7Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §19203-A, sub-§4-B is enacted to read:
84-B.  Test without consent.  An HIV test may be administered without consent or 
9 authorization if consent has not been obtained following a good faith effort to obtain 
10 consent and at least 8 hours have passed since exposure because:
11 A.  The source patient is incapacitated or is determined by that patient's attending health 
12 care provider to lack the mental capacity to provide such consent;
13 B.  The source patient is not expected to recover in time for the person who is exposed 
14 to receive appropriate medical treatment; and
15 C.  There is not a person immediately available who has legal authority to consent in 
16 time for the person who is exposed to receive appropriate medical treatment.
17 All other provisions of subsection 4-A regarding the administration of the HIV test and the 
18 results and documentation of the HIV testing apply to an HIV test conducted pursuant to 
19 this subsection.
20Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
21 takes effect when approved.
22SUMMARY
23 Under current law, if a person, while in the course of employment in a health care 
24 setting or as an emergency services worker, is exposed to potentially infectious blood or 
25 other bodily fluids of a patient in the course of employment, consent is required of the 
26 patient before a test for HIV may be performed.  Consent may be provided by certain other 
27 individuals if the patient is not present and cannot be contacted or is incapacitated.
28 This bill clarifies that the consent must be sought by a legal representative or 
29 administrator of the health care setting and that another individual who can authorize 
30 consent must be present.  This bill also allows an HIV test to be conducted without consent 
31 if, despite a good faith effort to obtain consent, at least 8 hours have passed since exposure 
32 and:
33 1.  The patient is incapacitated or is determined by that patient's attending health care 
34 provider to lack the mental capacity to provide such consent;
35 2.  The patient is not expected to recover in time for the person who is exposed to 
36 receive appropriate medical treatment; and
37 3.  There is not a person immediately available who has legal authority to consent in 
38 time for the person who is exposed to receive appropriate medical treatment.23
