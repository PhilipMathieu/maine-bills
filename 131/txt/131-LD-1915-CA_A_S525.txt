This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $10,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 to the Department of
Marine Resources (DMR) for expenditures related to seeding clams in conjunction with a grant program for shellfish
restoration projects. Without an emergency preamble and an emergency clause in the bill it will not become effective
until 90 days after adjournment of the 2nd Regular Session of the 131st Legislature. As the 2023-24 fiscal year will
have ended before the bill will be in effect, no appropriation will be made available to the DMR to accomplish the
goals of the bill.
