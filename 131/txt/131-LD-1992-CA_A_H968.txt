The amount of additional Other Special Revenue Funds revenue generated by the operation of terminals and the 
associated license revenue will depend on the number and location of terminals registered. If all entities who qualify. 
to seek a license do so, the additional licensing, administrative, and compliance activities associated with the terminals 
may increase the workload on the GCU staff. Any such increase is expected to be gradual and additional staffing for 
the GCU may need to be addressed in future budgets.
