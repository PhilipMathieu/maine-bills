241.  Statement of belief; protection of local interests.  The affidavit provided by the 
25 State Purchasing Agent  Chief Procurement Officer to bidders for contracts to provide 
26 goods covered by this subchapter must include a copy of the following statement:
27 "Maine is a state that believes employers should fairly compensate hard work, that the 
28 health and safety of working people should be protected and that no form of unlawful 
29 discrimination or abuse should be tolerated.  Maine citizens are aware that laws and 
30 regulations designed to safeguard basic tenets of ethical business practice are 
31 disregarded in many workplaces, commonly referred to as "sweatshops."  State 
32 Government purchase of goods made under abusive conditions on behalf of its citizens 
33 offends Maine citizens' sense of justice and decency.  Moreover, when the State of 
34 Maine contracts with vendors whose suppliers profit by providing substandard wages 
35 and working conditions, Maine's businesses are put at a competitive disadvantage.  
36 Therefore, the State of Maine believes in doing business with vendors who make a 
37 good faith effort to ensure that they and their suppliers at the point of assembly adhere 
38 to the principles of the State of Maine's purchasing code of conduct.
39 "In its role as a market participant that procures goods covered by this code, the State 
40 of Maine seeks to protect the interests of Maine citizens and businesses by exercising 
41 its state sovereignty to spend Maine citizens' tax dollars in a manner consistent with 
42 their expressed wishes that the State deal with responsible bidders who seek contracts 
43 to supply goods to the State of Maine, and protect legally compliant Maine businesses 
Page 9 - 131LR2923(01)
44 and workers from unfair competition created by downward pressure on prices and 
45 conditions attributable to businesses that violate applicable workplace laws.
