arising within all of Penobscot Indian territory. To the extent that the Penobscot Nation 
Tribal Court has exclusive jurisdiction over members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the 
Penobscot Nation under these provisions, it extends that exclusive jurisdiction to members 
of any of the Wabanaki Nations. It also provides that the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Penobscot Nation Tribal Court over domestic relations matters between members of the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, both of whom reside on the Penobscot

members of any of the Wabanaki Nations, both of whom reside within Passamaquoddy 
Indian territory. The amendment further recognizes the exclusive authority of the 
Penobscot Nation Tribal Court to enforce any drinking water ordinances adopted by the

credit to the judicial proceedings of the Penobscot Nation and that the Penobscot Nation
