Fiscal Detail and Notes
Under current law agents who collect the $5 deer registration fee when a harvested deer is registered remit $3 to the
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (DD:?W) and retain $2, Instead, this bill will require the total amount of
the registration fee to be remitted to DIFW with the $2 deposited in the Deer Management Fund (DMF). Using an
estimated 35,814 registrations, which is the average number of harvested deer from 2018 through 2023, the additional
$2 will generate $71,628 annually beginning in fiscal year 2024-25. The bill includes a corresponding allocation to
allow for the expenditure of additional revenue,
This bill also removes a ratio for types of expenditures from the DMF and adds new allowable uses of the fund. The
bill also directs DIPW to incorporate a check-offbox to the online licensing system to allow donations for assisting
with deer conflict prevention and management which will increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue,
