21SUMMARY
22 Current law provides an exemption from the excise tax imposed on vehicles owned by 
23 a person on active duty serving in the United States Armed Forces who is stationed in the 
24 State. This bill expands eligibility by amending the provision of law establishing the 
25 exemption to include a person on active duty stationed outside the State or who is deployed 
26 for more than 180 days. It further amends the exemption to include members of the National 
27 Guard and the Reserves of the United States Armed Forces. Finally, the bill repeals the 
28 provision of law that establishes a local option for municipalities to pass an ordinance 
29 offering the exemption established by the bill.22
