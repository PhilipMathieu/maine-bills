Fiscal Detail and Notes
This legislation prohibits the Loring Development Authority (LDA) of Maine from leasing, selling, demolishing,
reconstructing or transferring the ownership of the Loring Arch Hangar without approval of the Legislature obtaii
through the legislative process. It also requires the authority to transfer the ownership of the hangar to a nonprofit
organization established for the purpose of preserving the histoiy of the former Loring Air Force Base on or after June
1, 2025 if the Federal Aviation Administration does not approve the inclusion of the airfield at the former base into
the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) prior to June 1, 2025, This may result in a potential loss of
revenue to the authority that could have been received from leasing or selling the hangar,
According to testimony provided by the Loring Development Authority of Maine as well as Green 4 Maine, LLC
(G4M) during the committee hearing process, a Purchase and Sales agreement is currently in place between LDA and
G4M that provides G4M options to acquire certain parcels of property at the former base, including the airport and
hangar. The sale is subject to certain milestones being realized. An additional provision in the contract is that the sale
of the airport and hangar to G4M will only proceed if the LDA is not successful in obtaining the NPIAS status for the
airport within a certain timeframe. Whether this legislation will result in legal consequences and ramifications as well
as possible expenses to the LDA and the State can not be determined.
