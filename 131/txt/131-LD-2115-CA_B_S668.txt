5 SUMMARY
6 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
7 changes the title. The amendment does the following.
8 1. It prohibits debt collectors from charging any interest on debt or fees in connection
9 with the collection of debt that the debt collector knows is medical debt.
10 2. It prohibits debt collectors from pursuing litigation to compel payment of medical
11 debt without providing proof that the consumer was sent a written notice indicating that
12 litigation may not be pursued when the debt collector or collection agency knows the
13 consumer's household income is not more than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, as
14 defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and revised annually, and the
15 debt collector or collection agency provided the consumer with at least 30 days to provide
16 evidence that the consumer's household income is not more than 400% of the federal
17 poverty guidelines. The majority report of the committee sets the limit on a consumer's
18 household mcome at 3 00% of the federal poverty guidelines, instead of 400%.
19 3. It prohibits debt collectors from making false, deceptive or misleading
20 representations when attempting to collect debt that the debt collector or collection agency
21 knows is medical debt or to obtain information about a consumer in relation to an attempt
22 to collect medical debt that interest will accumulate on the debt prmcipal, that a fee will be
23 charged in connection with the debt or that the debt collector will pursue litigation to
24 compel payment of the debt.
