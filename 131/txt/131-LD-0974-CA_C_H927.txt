1:'his bill requ.ir~s that, beginning with the school year starting after June 30, 202°5, the minimum hourly wage for ' 
~ducatiohal techniciatrs is 150% of the state minimum hourly wage and the minimum hourly wage for other school 
support st~ff who are paid hourly is 125% of the state minimum hourly wage. The total cost of this provision is 
estimated to be $15,441,724 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $15,904,976 in fiscal year 2026-27. The General Purpose Aid 
for Local Schools program within the Department of Educ&tion will require ongoing General Fund appropiiations 
beginning in fiscal year 2025-26 for the State's share of the cost. Details of the future General Fund appropriations are 
provi.ded below. 
Public Law 2023, chapter 412. included ·a one-time General Fund appropriation of $80,000 in fiscal year 2023-24 to 
• the Department of Education to support the collection of current wage infonnation for school support staff in order to 
estimate the cost of any wage increase on the State and municipalities. The department indicates that it was able to 
collect data from 89% of the school administrative units surveyed. Based on the data collected, the department 
estimates the total cost of the wage increase for educational technicians and oth~r school support staff to be 
$14,781,013 in fiscal year 2025-26. Assuming a 3% increase in ,vage costs for fiscal year 2026-27, the total cost is 
estimated to be $15,224,443. This bill requires the State to fund 100% of the cost of this wage increase in fiscal year 
2025-26 only. Given this requirement, the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program will require a one-time 
General Fund appropriation of $14,781,013 in fiscal year 2025-26 and ongoing General Fund appropriations of 
$8,373,444 per year beginning in fiscal year 2026-27 for the State's share of the cost.

The increase in ·s•afaries will 11n.:rease the employer contribution for the norrnal cost component of the Maine Public 
Employers Retirement System (MainePERS). The rate for the nom1al cost component for fiscal year 2024-25 is 
4-.4-7%. Utilizing this rate as a proxy for the 2026-2027 biennium, the additional amount local scliool administrative 
units will have to pay to MainePERS for the normal cost of teacher retirement is estimated to be $660,711 in fiscal 
year 2025~26 and $680,533 in fiscal year 2026-27. The General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program will require a 
one-time GeneralFlind appropriation of $660;711 to reimburse 100% of this cost in fiscal year 2025-26 only and 
ongoing General Fund appropriations of $374,293 per year beginning in fiscal year 2026-27 to fund the State's share 
of this cost. 
It is important to note that certain cost components within the EPS funding model are expenditure driven, while other 
cost components are not. For those components that are expenditure driven, it will be 2 years before the salary 
increase will be reflected in the total cost of education as dete1mined by the model. Until then school administrative 
units will be responsible for funding 100% of the cost of this initiative. The methodology used by the department to 
collect cu11'ent wage info1mation for educational technicians and other school support staff did not allow for the data 
to be sorted by these components, so no estimate of the costs by expenditure driven and non-expenditure driven 
components is available. 
Although not addressed in the bill, incrementally increasing minimum salaty thresholds may put pressure on SAU's to 
raise salaries for other employees who are already above the minimum. Any additional salary increases SAU's may 
choose to provide would be fully funded by the SAU's unless the Commissioner of Education recommends adjusting 
the salaty matrix within the essential programs and services funding model and these changes get implemented,
