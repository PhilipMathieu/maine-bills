5 SUMMARY
6 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and changes the title. The
7 amendment does the following.
8 1. It removes the language that authorizes the Public Utilities Commission to provide
9 funds to the Governor's Energy Office from the Public Utilities Commission Regulatory
10 Fund for the office's administrative costs associated with the Distributed Solar and Energy
11 Storage Program established by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 2, section 9, subsection
12 6-A and requires the office to provide an annual report on the program.
13 2, Beginning October 1, 2024, it limits the number of customers who may share a
14 financial interest in a distributed generation resource and participate in the kilowatt-hour
15 credit and tariff rate net energy billing programs to 20 customers subject to certain
16 conditions. It creates exceptions to the limitation for a customer participating in net energy
17 billing pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to October 1,2024 and for a municipality
18 if the distributed generation resource is on the same side of the meter as the municipality
19 and at least 25% of the net energy billing credits associated with the output of the
20 distributed generation resource are allocated to the municipality.
21 3, Beginning October 1, 2024, it limits the nameplate capacity of a distributed
22 generation resource that may be used for the kilowatt-hour credit and tariff rate net energy
23 billing programs to one megawatt or less, except the limitation does not apply to a customer
24 participating m accordance with an agreement entered into prior to October 1,2024. It also
25 creates an exception to this limitation for a distributed generation resource in the
26 kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program that applies if the distributed generation
27 resource is owned by the customer and is used to serve the electric load of that customer
28 only and 100% of the net energy billing credits associated with the distributed generation
29 resource are allocated to the retail account of that customer.
30 4, It provides that, after December 31, 2044, a person is prohibited from participating
31 in the tariff rate net energy billing program and the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing
32 program, except that a person may participate in the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing
33 program beyond December 31, 2044 m connection with a project approved by the
34 commission as described in Title 35-A, section 3209-A, subsection 10.
35 5. It establishes limitations on participation in the kilowatt-hour credit and tariff rate
3 6 net energy billing programs for distributed generation resources with a nameplate capacity
37 of greater than one megawatt and not more than 2 megawatts.
38 6. It provides that a customer participating in the tariff rate net energy billing program
39 who remains eligible to participate in the program may receive a bill credit based on the
40 tariff rate for a period of no less than 20 years from the date of first receiving the credit or
41 until December 3 1,2044, whichever occurs first.

This bill removes a provision enacted in LD 1986 (P.L. 2023, c.411) that authorized the Public Utilities Commiss;
(PUC) to provide funds for administrative costs to the Governor's Energy Office (GEO) from the PUC Regulatory
Fund. Because the bill retains the provisions that allow the PUC to provide funding from the PUC Reimbursement
Fund, no changes are required to the allocations provided in LD 1986.
Any additional costs to the PUC or the GEO to implement the other provisions of this bill are expected to be minor
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources,
