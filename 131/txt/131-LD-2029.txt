13 This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing marine resources.

16 suspended when the criminal conviction is related to any activity for which a marine 
17 resources license or certificate is required.
18 2.  It adds conviction of a certain violation involving offenses against a person to the 
19 list of offenses for which a marine resources license or certificate may be suspended when 
20 the offense is directly related to an activity for which a marine resources license or 
21 certificate is required.
22 3.  For administrative suspensions of a marine resources license or certificate, it amends 
23 the existing suspensions for setting fire to, sinking or damaging a vessel used to carry out 
24 activities authorized under a lobster and crab fishing license to any marine resources license 
25 or certificate.
26 4.  It amends what conduct would qualify for a suspension of a marine resources license 
27 or certificate to include conduct that would constitute a violation involving theft by 
28 unauthorized taking or transfer, receiving stolen property, arson and aggravated criminal 
29 mischief when that conduct is directly related to an activity for which a marine resources 
30 license or certificate is required.
