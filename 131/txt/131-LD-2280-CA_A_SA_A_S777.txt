This amendment eliminates the Other Special Revenue Funds allocations totaling $12,000,000 in fiscal year 2024-25 
to the Maine Apprenticeship Program within the Department of Labor to support preapprenticeship training programs 
and, instead, provides a one-time Federal Expenditures Fund allocation in the same amount to the Department of 
Labor to authorize the expenditure of a portion of federal funds received by the State from the Infrastructure 
Invesh11ent and Jobs Act of 2021, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and any other federal Act providing new or 
expanded funding that is available on or after July 1, 2024 for workforce development activities, or for the creation of 
high wage, in-demand jobs in apprenticeable occupations. A Federal Expenditures Fund allocation for the same 
amount will be required in fiscal year 2025-26 as well. This amendment also eliminates the one-time transfer of 
$12,000,000 from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the Maine Apprenticeship Program included in 
the bill to fund the program.
