15 SUMMARY
16 This amendment repeals and replaces the provision of law defining "machine gun." In
17 the amendment, the definition of "machine gun" includes the same language that defines
18 "machine gun" under current law and adds to the definition: a device that, when attached
19 to a semi-automatic firearm, materially increases the rate of fire of the semi-automatic
20 firearm or approximates the operation or rate of fire of a machine gun; a device, part or
21 combination of parts designed to increase the rate of fire of a semi-automatic firearm by
22 eliminating the need to make a separate movement for each individual operation of the
23 trigger; and a semi-automatic firearm that has been modified to materially increase its rate
24 of fu-e or to approximate the operation or rate of fire of a machine gun. The amendment
25 also defines "semi-automatic firearm."
26 Finally, the amendment directs the Attorney General to update rules governing the
27 disposition of forfeited firearms under state law.
