SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
enacts the Crisis Intervention Order Act. Under the Act, a petition for a crisis intervention 
order, which prohibits the purchase, possession or control of a dangerous weapon, may be 
sought if a person is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing severe harm to the 
person or to another person. A significant danger of causing severe harm to the person or 
another person is demonstrated by establishing that the person has: inflicted or attempted 
to inflict bodily harm on another person; placed another person in reasonable fear of 
physical harm; by action or inaction, presented a danger to persons in the person's care; or 
threatened or attempted suicide or has threatened or attempted serious bodily harm. The 
petition may be filed by a family or household member of the person or by a law 
enforcement agency or a law enforcement officer and must be supported by an affidavit 
stating the facts to support the allegations, identifying any firearms believed to be in the 
person's possession and stating whether the person is already the subject of an existing 
protection from harassment or protection from abuse order. Upon receipt of the petition 
and affidavit, the District Court is required to schedule a hearing, which must be held within 
14 days of the filing of the petition, and provide notice of the hearing to the person who is 
the subject of the requested crisis intervention order. Following the hearing, if the court 
finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a significant risk of causing 
severe harm to the person or to another person, the court must issue an order prohibiting, 
for up to one year, the person from purchasing, possessing or receiving a dangerous

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ··1?' to H.P. 1470, L.D. 2283 
weapon, attempting to purchase, possess or receive a dangerous weapon or having custody 
or control of a dangerous weapon. 
The amendment allows a court to issue an emergency crisis intervention order without 
prior notice to the person who is the subject of the requested order. A hearing must be 
scheduled no later than 14 days after the order is issued. 
A crisis intervention order may be terminated upon the request of the person who is the 
subject of the order if that person shows by clear and convincing evidence that the person 
no longer poses a significant danger of causing severe harm to the person or another person. 
A crisis intervention order may be renewed for an additional period ofup to one year. 
A person who is the subject of a crisis intervention order immediately must surrender 
all dangerous weapons in that person's possession, custody or control to a law enforcement 
agency or a federally licensed firearm dealer, manufacturer or importer. 
The amendment directs the Department of Public Safety to submit a report on the status 
of obtaining federal funding related to storing dangerous weapons in the custody of law 
enforcement agencies and authorizes the committee to report out legislation to the 132nd 
Legislature. 
Finally, the amendment requires law enforcement agencies to prioritize probable cause 
determinations under the State's so-called yellow flag law. The amendment also allows a 
3rd-party informant who is a family or household member to seek a show cause order if 
the law enforcement officer is unable or unwilling to make a determination of whether to 
take the person into protective custody. If the law enforcement officer is unable or 
unwilling to make that determination, the family or household member may seek a crisis 
intervention order or emergency crisis intervention order. The amendment also provides 
that, regardless of whether a crisis intervention order or emergency crisis intervention order 
is issued, the law enforcement officer may still take the person into protective custody. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
