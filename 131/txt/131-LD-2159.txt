22SUMMARY
23 Public Law 2023, chapter 394 specified the consequences for the interception of an 
24 oral or wire communication, including a telephone call, between a person residing in either 
25 a jail or in an adult or juvenile correctional facility and an attorney; these communications 
26 are confidential.  This bill extends those consequences to an intercepted attorney-client e-
27 mail communication if the resident can show that the jail or correctional facility had actual 
28 or constructive notice at the time the e-mail communication was made or intercepted of the 
29 attorney's name and the attorney's e-mail address and if the communication was made 
30 directly to or from that e-mail address.  Similar to Public Law 2023, chapter 394, the bill 
31 provides that:
32 1. The contents and existence of the communication are not admissible in a criminal 
33 proceeding, including a post-conviction review proceeding;
34 2. A person who viewed, listened to or read the communication and did not 
35 immediately discontinue doing so as soon as the person had sufficient information to 
36 determine that the communication was protected by attorney-client privilege is disqualified 
37 from participating in an investigation of the resident and from appearing as a witness in a 
38 criminal proceeding in which the resident is a defendant, including a post-conviction 
39 review proceeding; and
40 3. A person who viewed, listened to or read the intercepted communication and saw, 
41 heard or read information that may be relevant to a pending or anticipated charge against 
42 the resident or a defense the resident may assert, or that may lead to the discovery of that 
43 evidence, is disqualified from participating in an investigation of the resident or appearing 23
