SUMMARY 
This amendment, which replaces the bill, retains but clarifies the provision from the 
bill that provides that more than on~ registrant may operate a game of chance at the same 
time on the same premises and that, when games of chance are to be operated during the 
annual fair of an agricultural society, the agricultural society must determine the number 
of registrants permitted to operate a game of chance. It also provides, as in the bill, that a 
bona fide nonprofit organization may operate a registered game of chance to which the 
general public has access no more than 4 times in a calendar year for a period not to exceed 
the duration of the annual fair of an agricultural society or the duration of a special event, 
rather than for a period not to exceed 4 consecutive days as in current law. 
The amendment makes other technical changes to provide clarity to the provisions 
related to the imposition of a fine of not more than $100 per violation on a beano or game 
of chance licensee or registrant or a licensee's or registrant's agent or employee that has 
violated the laws or rules governing beano or games of chance, subject to an appeal and
