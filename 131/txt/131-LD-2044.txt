21 Current law requires the Department of Environmental Protection to disseminate a 
22 health warning to the mass media when ground-level ozone concentrations have exceeded 
23 or will exceed .08 parts per million averaged over an 8-hour period.  This bill instead 
24 requires the department to disseminate a health warning to the mass media when ambient 
25 air concentrations of a pollutant reach the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 
26 Air Quality Index category of Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups or a higher category.  The 
27 bill also requires the department to disseminate health warnings directly to the public using 
28 appropriate technology and authorizes the use of other appropriate technology besides a 
29 telephone hotline when providing information to the public on daily ground-level ozone 
30 concentrations.21
