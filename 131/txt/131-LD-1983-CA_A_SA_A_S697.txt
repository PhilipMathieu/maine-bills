Fiscal Note
Expands definition of local labor market
Fiscal Detail and Notes
Changing the definition of local labor market to include any market outside of this State if any portion of that market
is within 100 miles of the border instead of within 75 miles of the border will mean more businesses will be subjer*" to
certain provisions of this bill. That incremental change is not expected to impact the fiscal note associated with th
bill.
