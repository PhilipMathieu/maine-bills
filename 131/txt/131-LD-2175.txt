Page 1 - 131LR2797(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the federal drug pricing program under Section 340B of the federal Public 
4 Health Service Act, 42 United States Code, Section 256b requires prescription drug 
5 manufacturers to offer discounted pricing to certain covered entities, including federally 
6 qualified health centers; and
7Whereas, federally qualified health centers serve rural and other underserved areas, 
8 delivering health care that would otherwise be inaccessible to residents of such areas; and
9Whereas, a crucial part of such care is the provision of life-saving prescription drugs 
10 at affordable prices made possible by the 340B program, which also generates savings that 
11 federally qualified health centers must, as a matter of mission and federal law, use to reduce 
12 costs and improve access to services for patients of those health centers; and
13Whereas, prescription drug manufacturers have recently imposed conflicting and 
14 burdensome requirements for covered entities to obtain discounted pricing under the 340B 
15 program, depriving patients of access to affordable prescription drugs under the 340B 
16 program; and
17Whereas, the number of retail pharmacies and the hours of operation of retail 
18 pharmacies in underserved areas of the State have been dramatically reduced in recent years 
19 due to workforce challenges and other economic challenges; and
20Whereas, federally qualified health centers can compensate for the decline in 
21 availability of retail pharmacies and for the restrictive practices of prescription drug 
22 manufacturers only by developing or expanding their capacity to provide retail pharmacy 
23 services as part of their health center services, yet existing health center revenues and 
24 resources are insufficient to support such development and expansion; and
25Whereas, it is therefore essential to provide immediate funding support for federally 
26 qualified health centers to develop and expand retail pharmacy capacity in this State to 
27 address the critical shortage of access to affordable prescription drugs; and
28Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
29 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
30 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
31 therefore,
32Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
33Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §259, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. JJJ, §1, 
34 is further amended to read:
35 B.  Six hundred ninety-nine thousand, one hundred fifty dollars in fiscal year 2001-02 
36 to federally qualified health centers to support the infrastructure of these programs in 
37 providing primary care services to underserved populations.  Forty-four thousand, two 
38 hundred fifty dollars must be provided to each federally qualified health center with an 
39 additional $8,850 for the 2nd and each additional site operated by a federally qualified 
40 health center.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "site" means a site or sites operated 
41 by the federally qualified health center within its scope of service that meet all health 
42 center requirements, including providing primary care services, regardless of patients' 
Page 2 - 131LR2797(01)43 ability to pay, 5 days a week with extended hours.  If there is not sufficient funding to 
44 meet the formula in this paragraph, the $699,150 must be allocated in proportion to the 
45 formula outlined in this paragraph; and
4Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §259, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. JJJ, §1, is 
5 amended to read:
6 C.  Five hundred thousand dollars, beginning with fiscal year 2015-16 and continuing 
7 each fiscal year thereafter, to support access to primary medical, behavioral health and 
8 dental services to residents of the State in rural and underserved communities and to 
9 assist with provider recruitment and retention.  Twenty-five thousand dollars must be 
10 provided to each federally qualified health center. ; and
11Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §259, sub-§1, ¶D is enacted to read:
12 D.  Seven million five hundred thousand dollars in fiscal year 2024-25 to support access 
13 to pharmacy services and affordably priced prescription drugs to residents of the State 
14 in rural and underserved communities by providing funds to support federally qualified 
15 health centers in developing or improving pharmacy services, including without 
16 limitation:
17 (1) Planning, designing, constructing and operating one or more licensed retail 
18 pharmacies as part of a federally qualified health center's services; 
19 (2) Entering into arrangements, including with one or more federally qualified 
20 health centers, to expand the availability of prescription drugs purchased and 
21 delivered to patients under the federal drug pricing program under Section 340B 
22 of the federal Public Health Service Act, 42 United States Code, Section 256b; and 
23 (3) Expanding access to prescription drugs supplied by one or more federally 
24 qualified health centers, including without limitation by increasing the number of 
25 locations from which patients may obtain prescription drugs, improving existing 
26 pharmacy facilities, expanding the availability of automated pharmacy systems as 
27 defined in Title 32, section 13702-A, subsection 1 or addressing workforce issues 
28 related to pharmacy program planning and operation.
29Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §259, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
303.  Allocation of pharmacy services support funding.  Each federally qualified health 
31 center may apply for funds made available pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph D by 
32 providing the Office of Affordable Health Care, as established in Title 5, section 3122, with 
33 a budget and plan for developing or improving pharmacy services and access to affordably 
34 priced prescription drugs for its patients.  The Office of Affordable Health Care shall 
35 allocate available funds equitably among all applicants based on the cost-effectiveness and 
36 feasibility of the proposed development or improvement of patient access to affordably 
37 priced prescription drugs.  In developing criteria for awarding available funds, the Office 
38 of Affordable Health Care shall consult with and consider the recommendations of a 
39 statewide association of federally qualified health centers. Any available funds not awarded 
40 in fiscal year 2024-25 must be deposited in a nonlapsing account from which awards may 
41 be made in subsequent fiscal periods for the purposes set forth in subsection 1, paragraph 
42 D.1
