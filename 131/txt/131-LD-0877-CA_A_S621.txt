Potential current biennium cost increase - All funds
Minor revenue increase - General Fund
Minor revenue increase - Other Special Revenue Funds
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements
This bill establishes new civil violations and may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. The
additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require
additional funding at this time.
The collection of additional fines and filing fees will increase General Fund or other dedicated revenue by minor
amounts.
Fiscal Detail and Notes
Prohibiting government agencies from contracting with companies or using or purchasing information and
communications technology and services that are identified by the Department of Administrative and Financial
Services as posing a national security risk or a risk to security of persons in the United States could increase costs to
the extent this prohibition limits access to lower cost goods, technology and services.
Additional costs to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services to establish and publish a list of
prohibited companies and a list of prohibited information and communication technology and services that.pose
security risks are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
