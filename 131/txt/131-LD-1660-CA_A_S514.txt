13 'An Act to Ensure Proper Regulation of Chemical Plastic Processing'
14 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the
15 following:
16 'See. 1. 38 MRSA §1303-C, sub-§2-C is enacted to read:
17 2-C. Chemical plastic processine. ''ChemicaLfi^^^^ processing" means the
18 processing of plastic waste using chemical or molecular methods mto basic raw materials.
19 feedstock chemicals. fuel for combustion, waxes or lubricants. "Chemical plastic
20 processme" does not include plastic-to-plastic recycling.
21 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §1303-C, sub-§19-D is enacted to read;
22 19-D. Plastic. "Plastic" means a synthetic material made from linking monomers,
23 through a chemical reaction to create_a^polYmer chain, mcluding material derived from

27 production from plastic waste of new plastic material, designedto^ _be used a^
28 feedstock in placeof raw material for the manufacture of new products made of or

30 elastic material:
31 A. Retains the chemical stmcture_ofthe_Glasticwa^^^
32 B. Deconstructs the plastic waste into molecular precursors or intermediates and then
3 3 reconstitutes the precursors or intermediates into plastic polvmers usine methods that
34 result exclusively in the production of new plastic material.

3 amended to read:
4 32-A. Solid waste processing facility. "Solid waste processing facility" means a land
5 area, structure, equipment, machine, device, system or combination thereof, other than an
6 incineration facility, that is operated to reduce the volume or change the chemical or
7 physical characteristics of solid waste. "Solid waste processing facility" includes but is not
8 limited to a facility that processes plastic waste through chemical plastic orocessine and a
9 facility that employs shredding, baling, mechanical and magnetic separation or composting
10 or other stabilization technique to reduce or otherwise change the nature of solid waste.
11 Sec. 5. 38 MRSA §1310-N, sub-§5-A, ^B, as amended by PL 2023, c. 283,§1, is
12 farther amended by amending subparagraph (2) to read:
13 (2) A solid waste processing facility that generates residue requirmg disposal shall
14 recycle or process into fuel for combustion through methods other than chemical
15 plastic processing all waste accepted at the facility to the maximum extent
16 practicable, but in no case at a rate less than 50%. For puiposes of this subsection,
17 "recycle" includes does not include chemical plastic processing and does include,
18 but is not limited to, plastic-to-plastic recycling; the reuse of waste generated
19 within the State as defined in section 13 03-C, subsection 40-A, paragraph C; the
20 recovery of metals from waste; the use of waste or waste-derived product as
21 material substitites in construction; and the use of waste as boiler fuel substitutes.
22 At least 50% of the waste that a solid waste processing facility characterizes as
23 recycled under this subparagraph must have been reused or recycled by the facility
24 through methods other than placement of the waste in a solid waste landfill!, except
25 that a solid waste processing facility that was in operation during calendar year
26 2018, that accepts exclusively construction and demolition debris and that accepted
27 more than 200,000 tons of such debris in calendar year 2018 shall:
28 (a) Reuse or recycle at least 15% of such debris through methods other than
29 placement in a solid waste landfill by July 1, 2024;

1 Sec. 7. 38 MRSA §1310-Y, first ^, as amended by PL 2001,c. 575, §1, is further
2 amended to read:
3 An owner or operator of a solid waste processing facility that processes plastic waste
4 through chemical plastic processing that is licensed under section 1310-N or of a solid
5 waste disposal facility that is licensed under section 1310-N shall provide the department
6 assurance of its financial ability to satisfy the estimated cost of corrective action for known
7 releases from the facility and its financial capacity to satisfy the estimated cost of closure
8 and postclosure care and maintenance at the facility for a period of at least 30 years after
9 closure. The board may adopt rules that increase or decrease that postclosure care period,
10 as long as those rules are consistent with applicable federal mles. The department may
11 consider the use of more than one acceptable form of financial assurance per facility to
12 satisfy the financial assurance requirement of this section. This section applies to all
13 privately owned solid waste disposal facilities licensed by the department, including
14 facilities licensed by the department before June 16,1 993, and to all solid waste processing
15 facilities that process plastic waste through chemical plastic processing. This section does
16 not apply to a municipally owned or operated solid waste disposal facility that accepts
17 exclusively special waste, constmction and demolition debris, land-clearing debris or any
18 combination of those types of waste or to a municipally owned or operated solid waste
19 disposal facility licensed before June 16, 1993.
20 Sec. 8. 38 MRSA §1310-Y, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1993,c.378,§9, is amended
21 to read:
22 2. Report. An owner or operator of a solid waste processing facility that processes
23 plastic waste through chemical plastic processing or of a solid waste disposal facility shall
24 annually prepare a report containing a sworn statement providing the year-end balance of
25 any escrow, trust or reserve account established under this section. That report must be
26 submitted to the commissioner by March 31st of each year or such other date as the

29 number to read consecutively.
30 SUMMARY
31 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
32 changes the title. It amends the solid waste laws to defme "chemical plastic processing,"
33 "plastic" and "plastic-to-plastic recycling" and clarifies that a facility that processes plastic
34 waste through chemical plastic processing is a solid waste processing facility. "Chemical
3 5 plastic processing" is defined as the processing of plastic waste usmg chemical or molecular
36 methods into basic raw materials, feedstock chemicals, fuel for combustion, waxes or
37 lubricants and does not include plastic-to-plastic recycling, The amendment also provides
38 that, for the purposes of the recycling and source reduction determination requirement
39 generally applicable to solid waste processing facilities, a solid waste processing facility
40 may not count as recycled any plastic waste processed through chemical plastic processing.
41 Finally, the amendment requires a solid waste processing facility that processes plastic
