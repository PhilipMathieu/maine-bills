Page 1 - 131LR2755(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
4 period in order for the Public Utilities Commission to perform its duties under this 
5 legislation in a timely fashion so that new standards and metrics are introduced into new 
6 electricity rate cases as soon as possible to benefit ratepayers and the public and ensure 
7 alignment with the State's climate policies; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง307, sub-ยง6 is enacted to read:
146.  General increase in rates; performance-based metrics; rate adjustment 
15mechanisms.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the commission may 
16 establish performance-based metrics and rate adjustment mechanisms in a proceeding for 
17 a general increase in rates.
18Sec. 2.  Public Utilities Commission to conduct review of performance-
19based metrics and rate adjustment mechanisms.
201.  Commission proceeding.  No later than September 30, 2024, the Public Utilities 
21 Commission, referred to in this section as "the commission," shall initiate a proceeding to 
22 establish a framework enhancing the performance-based metrics in the Maine Revised 
23 Statutes, Title 35-A, section 301, subsection 1-A, paragraph A.  The framework must set 
24 clear objectives benefiting ratepayers and the public.
252.  Objectives; considerations.  In conducting a proceeding to establish a framework 
26 pursuant to subsection 1, the commission shall consider, but is not limited to considering, 
27 objectives that would benefit ratepayers and the public and would achieve the following:
28 A.  Promotion of efficient, cost-effective utility operations;
29 B.  Increased planning and preparation for extreme weather events and climate hazards;
30 C.  Cost-effective and comprehensive response to outages;
31 D.  Increased affordability and customer empowerment and satisfaction; and
32 E.  Advancement of the State's climate policies, including those described in the 
33 climate action plan update submitted pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, 
34 section 577, subsection 1 and the greenhouse gas emissions reduction levels specified 
35 in Title 38, section 576-A.
36 The framework must detail specific standards and metrics for assessing transmission and 
37 distribution utility performance relative to those objectives.
38 The commission shall also consider performance-based metrics and rate adjustment 
39 mechanisms used in other states.
Page 2 - 131LR2755(01)13.  Standards and metrics development.  The development of standards and metrics 
2 for some objectives may benefit from a period of data collection and analysis.  The 
3 commission may conduct such data collection and analysis.
44.  Application of standards and metrics.  The commission shall identify how the 
5 standards and metrics in subsection 2 must be applied, including the time frame and extent.  
6 The commission may use a period of data collection and analysis to identify how to apply 
7 the standards and metrics in subsection 2.
85.  Evaluation of performance.  The commission shall require a transmission and 
9 distribution utility, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 102, 
10 subsection 20-B, to provide data necessary to determine if the transmission and distribution 
11 utility has met the objectives in subsection 2 and shall evaluate the transmission and 
12 distribution utility's performance.  If a transmission and distribution utility does not meet 
13 an objective in subsection 2 and is subject to a negative financial incentive, the commission 
14 shall provide an opportunity for the transmission and distribution utility to demonstrate 
15 good cause for its failure to meet the objective and, if the commission finds good cause, 
16 the commission may modify or eliminate the negative financial incentive in accordance 
17 with its finding.
186.  Implementation of innovative rate adjustment mechanisms.  The commission 
19 shall identify specific and innovative rate adjustment mechanisms to be implemented to 
20 align transmission and distribution utility performance with the standards and metrics 
21 adopted pursuant to this section, including, but not limited to, reviewing the effectiveness 
22 of the transmission and distribution utility's revenue decoupling of utility profits from 
23 utility sales to achieve goals, use of the total of operations and capital expenses as the basis 
24 for ratemaking rather than capital expenses alone and use of cost of equity as the minimum 
25 to be recovered by utilities in rates, with any recovery above that amount determined by 
26 utility performance.
277.  Technical policy group.  The commission shall create a technical policy group to 
28 collect data, conduct analysis, develop standards and metrics, monitor performance and 
29 recommend rate adjustment based on performance.  The group must also conduct the 
30 assessments of innovative rate adjustment mechanisms identified in subsection 6.  The 
31 commission may hire 3 full-time employees for this purpose.
328.  Report.  No later than January 15, 2025, the commission shall submit a report 
33 regarding its analysis of performance-based metrics and rate adjustment mechanisms in 
34 this section, including recommended legislation, to the joint standing committee of the 
35 Legislature having jurisdiction over utility matters.
36Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
37 takes effect when approved.

3 include, but is not limited to, objectives such as operational efficiency and cost-
4 effectiveness; resilience and emergency response; affordability and customer 
5 empowerment and satisfaction; and advancement of the State's climate policies.  The 
6 framework must also detail specific standards and metrics for assessing transmission and 
7 distribution utility performance relative to these objectives.  The commission must also 
8 consider performance-based metrics and rate adjustment mechanisms used in other states;
9 2.  Identify how the standards and metrics set out in the framework must be applied;

11 align transmission and distribution utility performance with such standards and metrics;
12 4.  Establish a technical policy group within the commission to collect data, conduct 
13 analysis, develop standards and metrics, monitor performance and recommend rate 
14 adjustment based on performance.  The group must also conduct the assessments of
