1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the inability of a municipality or the Maine Land Use Planning Commission 
4 to claim a lien against real estate on which a shoreland zoning violation occurred may leave 
5 the municipality or commission without recourse to obtain payment of attorney's fees and 
6 court costs and any unpaid penalties when the real estate is sold; and
7Whereas, municipalities and the Maine Land Use Planning Commission are currently 
8 taking enforcement actions against shoreland zoning violations on real estate that may be 
9 sold before the expiration of the 90-day period; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13 therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
15Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §685-C, sub-§8-A is enacted to read:
168-A.  Restriction of permits when violation in the shoreland zone; lien claim.  The

19 related to development in the shoreland zone:
20 A.  The commission may restrict the issuance of or suspend or revoke any permit issued 
21 to the owner of the real estate by the commission; and
22 B.  The commission may claim a lien against the real estate for all costs related to the 
23 violation incurred by the commission, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and 
24 court costs, and any unpaid penalties imposed on the owner of the real estate.  The 
25 commission or the commission's designee shall file a notice of the lien under this 
26 paragraph with the register of deeds of the county in which the real estate is located.  
27 Not less than 10 days prior to the filing, the commission or the commission's designee
