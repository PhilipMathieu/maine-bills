2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the inability of a municipality or the Maine Land Use Planning Commission 
4 to claim a lien against real estate on which a shoreland zoning violation occurred may leave 
5 the municipality or commission without recourse to obtain payment of attorney's fees and 
6 court costs and any unpaid penalties when the real estate is sold; and
7Whereas, municipalities and the Maine Land Use Planning Commission are currently 
8 taking enforcement actions against shoreland zoning violations on real estate that may be 
9 sold before the expiration of the 90-day period; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13 therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
15Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง685-C, sub-ยง8-A is enacted to read:
