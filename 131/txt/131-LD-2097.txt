1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child and Family 
4 Services is experiencing a shortage of caseworkers; and
5Whereas, this staffing shortage means that existing staff are overworked and in need 
6 of assistance, which in turn limits the office's ability to provide necessary child protective 
7 services; and
8Whereas, this legislation establishes a pilot project for the recruitment and 
9 employment of case aides to provide visitation supervision, referral and administrative 
10 services as support for caseworkers; and
11Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect as soon as possible so that new case 
12 aides providing support to caseworkers may be recruited and begin their work; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore, be it
17Sec. 1. Case aides pilot project. Resolved: That, by June 1, 2024, the Department 
18 of Health and Human Services shall develop and implement a pilot project in the 
19 department's Office of Child and Family Services for the recruitment and employment of 
20 case aides in the child protective services system for those areas of the child protective 
21 services system where there is the greatest need for assistance, as determined by the 
22 department.  The pilot project must include a public recruitment campaign that targets 
23 retirees and other persons not in the workforce.
24 In developing the pilot project, the department shall consider:
25 1. Higher rates of compensation for case aides hired under the pilot project;
26 2. Whether case aides hired under the pilot project would be covered by collective 
27 bargaining agreements;
28 3. The development of appropriate internship programs for credit;
29 4. The use of signing bonuses;
30 5. The availability of flexible work hours; and
31 6. Other incentives as determined by the department for the recruitment and 
32 employment of case aides.
33Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That, by November 6, 2024, the Department of Health 
34 and Human Services shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
35 having jurisdiction over health and human services matters addressing the implementation 
36 and effectiveness of the pilot project under section 1 and making recommendations 
37 regarding further recruitment and employment efforts. The joint standing committee may 
38 submit legislation to the 132nd Legislature in 2025 to continue or expand the pilot project.
