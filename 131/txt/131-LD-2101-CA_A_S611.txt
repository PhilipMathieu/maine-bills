Fiscal Note Required: Yes
Fiscal Note
Minor cost increase - General Fund
Minor revenue increase - General Fund
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements
This bill may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. The additional workload associated with <'1'°
minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require additional funding at this time.
The collection of additional filing fees will increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts.
Fiscal Detail and Notes
Any additional costs to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to adopt the changes in this bill are
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
If a municipality chooses to exercise the authority provided in the bill to take certain actions when a land owner or
occupant violates a shoreline zoning ordinance, any minor costs associated with these actions are expected to be offset
by revenue increases from the recoupment of unpaid penalties, attorney's fees and court costs associated with the
ordinance violation.
