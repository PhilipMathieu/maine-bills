Minor revenue increase - Other Special Revenue Funds
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements
This bill adds a requirement to the stalking, terrorizing and harassment laws for Class C, D and E crimes that the
person must have consciously disregarded a substantial risk that the person's speech would place a reasonable person
in fear of bodily injury. It is unclear how many individuals may not be convicted of a Class C crime who otherwise
would have been. The current average cost of incarcerating one individual for a single year is $55,203. No
appropriations are reduced in this bill to reflect potential cost savings to the Department of Corrections.
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require
additional funding at this time.
The collection of additional fines will increase General Fund or other dedicated revenue by minor .amounts.
