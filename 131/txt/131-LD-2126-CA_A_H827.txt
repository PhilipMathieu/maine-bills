COMMITTEE AMENDMENT •A "to H.P. 1350, L.D. 2126 
I SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment authorizes the delegation of specific 
3 nursing activities and tasks by a nurse to unlicensed assistive personnel, but preserves the 
4 authority of a nurse, in the exercise of the nurse's professional judgment, to refuse to 
5 delegate specific nursing activities and tasks in any care setting. The amendment also 
6 specifies that the authorization to delegate may not be construed to require a nurse to 
7 delegate, or permit a person to coerce a nurse into delegating, specific nursing activities 
8 and tasks against the nurse's professional judgment. The amendment defines "unlicensed 
9 assistive personnel" and requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt major substantive 
10 rules concerning delegation.
