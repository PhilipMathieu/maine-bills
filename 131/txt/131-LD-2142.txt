42 opportunities to individuals regardless of their race or color, sex, sexual orientation or 
43 gender identity, physical or mental disability, religion, age, ancestry, national origin or

37 demonstrating that such a relationship exists;

41SUMMARY
42 This bill amends the Maine Human Rights Act to correct references to orders of 
43 protection under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, former section 4007, which was 1
2

42
43
Page 7 - 131LR2749(01)44 repealed on January 1, 2023, to final protection orders under Title 19-A, section 4110.  The 
45 bill also provides protection from discrimination for individuals who have received 
46 substantially similar orders of protection from courts in other states or countries.
4 The bill also changes a reference from "husband and wife" to "spouses" in a provision 
5 of the Maine Human Rights Act that addresses fair credit extension.
6 Finally, the bill replaces the Chief Compliance Officer, a position that no longer exists, 
7 with the Commission Counsel as a major policy-influencing position within the Maine 
8 Human Rights Commission.1
