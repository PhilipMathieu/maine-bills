This amendment eliminates the requirement in the bill that provides that the percentage of Maine Maritime Academy's 
(MMA) total state appropriation as a share of its total operating costs increase by 5% per year until the percentage of 
the MMA's total state appropriation as a share of its total operating costs equals at least the lesser of the percentage of 
the University of Maine System's (UMS) and the Maine Community College System's (MCCS) total state 
appropriation compared to each system's total operating costs and reduces the ongoing General Fund appropriations to 
all but $1,000,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2024-25. The amendment also removes the language that 
establishes the Commission to Study the Fund of Institutions of Higher Education.
