Potential cunent biennium cost increase - General Fund 
Referendum Costs Month/Year Election Type Question Length 
Nov-26 General Referendum Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $266,000 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to state agencies to replace the cmTent flag can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. This 
assumes that the changeover will occur gradually as the old ones become wom and frayed. Any costs to the 
Department of Secreta1y of State to serve on the conunission, provide administrative duties for the commission and to 
approve the flag design are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
