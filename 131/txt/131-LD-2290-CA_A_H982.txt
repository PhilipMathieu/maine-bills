COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 1478, L.D. 2290 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes from the bill the sections relating to the Maine Registry of 
Certified Nursing Assistants and Direct Care Workers in the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
Part B of the amendment corrects language enacted by Public Law 2023, chapter 615 
to reflect that a prosecuting agency seeks to indict and a grand jury indicts an individual 
but a prosecuting agency does not indict. 
Part C of the amendment corrects cross-references in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
19-A to the definitions of the terms "abuse" and "economic abuse" and a reference to the 
domestic violence intervention program. 
Part D clarifies the intent of the Legislature that the exception to the hearsay rule for 
recordings of forensic interviews in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 16, section 358, 
which was enacted by Public Law 2023, chapter 193, applies to proceedings pending on 
the date that the law was enacted and to proceedings initiated after that date, regardless of 
when the conduct described in the forensic interview allegedly occurred. The amendment 
adds language to the emergency preamble related to Part D.
