SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, differs from the majority 
report in that it limits the number of electronic lucky seven devices a federally recognized 
Indian tribe may operate to 50 of those devices on up to 2 separate premises instead of 100 
of those devices on up to 2 separate premises. It also authorizes the director of the Gambling 
Control Unit to collect from each licensee a fee equal to 1 % of net revenue from the 
operation of electronic lucky seven devices, rather than 1 % of gross revenue as in the 
majority report.

This bill makes changes to the rules regarding high-stakes beano licensing. It adds authorization to the charitable 
gaming laws allowing the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of Public Safety to issue licenses to 
operate electronic lucky seven devices to eligible organizations and to federally recognized Indian tribes and to collect 
1 % of the net revenue from licensees. 
License and application fees are estimated to generate $208,450 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue starting in 
fiscal year 2024-25. This assumes 315 eligible organizations will seek to acquire electronic lucky seven devices, 
dispensers and sealed ticket registrations. The GCU estimates that net revenue collected will generate $52,500 in 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue starting in fiscal year 2024-25. 
This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $774,422 to the GCU begim1ing in fiscal year 2024-25 for 
one Public Service Coordinator position, 2 Auditor II positions, 4 Public Safety Inspector I positions and associated 
costs. The bill also includes ongoing Other Special Revenue Fund allocations of $76,112 to the GCU beginning in 
fiscal year 2024-25 for costs associated with these positi.ons.
