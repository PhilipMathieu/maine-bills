Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill allows municipalities by referendum to impose a local option sales tax of 1% on short-term lodging that is
subject to the sales and use tax, It is not known how many and which municipalities will conduct a successful
referendum to impose such a tax, but those that do will see revenue increases. Maine Revenue Services has indicated
that there may be some reduction in the demand for short-term lodging because of the new tax, If that occurs there
would be some reduction in revenue to the General Fund, the Local Government Fund and the Tourism Marketing
Fund. This fiscal note does not reflect a reduction in revenue in these categories.
The bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services,
Bureau of Revenue Services of $98,927 in fiscal year 2024-25 for one Tax Examiner III position beginning October 1,
;.' . 2024 to administer a local option sales tax on short-term lodging. It also includes a one-time General Fund
appropriation to the Bureau of Revenue Services of $271,481 in fiscal year 2024-25 for computer programming,
implementation and testing and outreach costs associated with a local option sales tax.
. Additional costs to the Office of Treasurer of State associated with distributing local option sales tax revenue to
'partloipating municipalities are considered to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources,
