matters may report out a bill to the 132nd Legislature in 2025 based on the report provided 
in accordance with this section.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment, which is 
the majority report of the committee, does the following. 
In Part A, the amendment permits a provider that is actively treating an enrollee to act 
as an authorized representative of an enrollee for purposes of grievances and appeals of 
health insurance carrier decisions without requiring prior written authorization from the 
enrollee. The amendment does require that a provider actively treating an enrollee must 
notify an enrollee at least 14 days prior to filing a grievance or appeal and within 7 days 
after filing a grievance or appeal or withdrawing a grievance or appeal and also permits an 
enrollee to affirmatively object to the provider's action. 
The amendment requires carriers to allow prior authorization approvals to be effective 
for a 2-week period before and after a specific date. It also prohibits carriers from denying 
claims for nonemergency services that were within the scope of the enrollee's coverage 
pending medical necessity review and prohibits carriers from imposing a penalty of more 
than 15% of the contractually allowed amount for the services that required prior 
authorization approval on the provider for failing to obtain a prior authorization. 
The amendment prohibits carriers from making determinations of medical necessity 
based on whether those services are provided by participating or nonparticipating 
providers. The amendment also provides that, if a patient needs immediate post-evaluation 
or post-stabilization services, a carrier is prohibited from requiring prior authorization for 
those services provided during the same encounter. If post-evaluation or post-stabilization 
services necessitate inpatient care, a carrier is permitted to impose prior authorization for 
those services but carriers are required to respond to the prior authorization request within 
24 hours. If the provider does not receive a determination from the carrier within 24 hours, 
the care is deemed approved until the carrier affirmatively notifies the provider otherwise.

The bill prohibits carriers from denying claims for nonemergency services that were within the scope of the enrollee's 
coverage pending medical necessity review and prohibits carriers from imposing a penalty of more than 15% of the 
contracJually allowed amount for the services that required prior authorization approval on the provider for failing to 
obtain a prior authorization. 
The requirements of the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2025. The State Employee 
Health Plan's first impacted plan year will be SFY 2026 and is estimated to cost $110,874 annually thereafter. The

expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
