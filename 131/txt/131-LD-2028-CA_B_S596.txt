Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Amending the products subject to the tobacco products tax to include products containing synthetic nicotine will 
increase tobacco products tax revenue by $951,000 in fiscal year 2024-25 and increase sales tax revenue by $26,000 in 
fiscal year 2024-25. The increase in sales tax revenue results from an estimated increase in retail prices in response to 
the excise tax on products containing synthetic nicotine. Local Government Fund revenue will increase by $1,000 in 
fiscal year 2024-25. 
This bill also requires that transfers from the General Fund to several Other Special Revenue Fund accounts be 
calculated after the reduction of General Fund revenue for transfers of revenue attributable to tax collected on sales 
occurring on tribal lands. This will ensure that not more than 100% ofrevenue attributable to tax collected on sales 
occuring on tribal lands is transfened out of the General Fund and will result in minor decreases in revenue in the 
affected Other Special Revenue Funds accounts.
