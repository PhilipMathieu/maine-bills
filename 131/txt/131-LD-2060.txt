Page 1 - 131LR2698(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law does not allow applicants for licensure in this State as landscape 
4 architects to sit for the required examination before completing all of the required education 
5 and years of practical experience; and
6Whereas, current law creates a discrepancy, with no apparent reason or justification, 
7 between the licensing requirements for landscape architects and the licensing requirements 
8 for architects; and
9Whereas, current law thus creates an additional barrier for potential applicants for 
10 licensure as landscape architects to take the examination; and
11Whereas, the examination vendor has temporarily agreed to review education and 
12 experience qualifications for examination candidates through 2024 and has asked that this 
13 issue be addressed as soon as possible; and
14Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
17 therefore,
18Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
19Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §220, sub-§2, ¶B, as repealed and replaced by PL 2009, c. 415, 
20 Pt. A, §16, is amended by amending subparagraph (1) to read:
21 (1)  To  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, to be qualified for  admission 
22 to the examination  a license to practice landscape architecture in this State, an 
23 applicant must submit evidence to the board that  the applicant has passed an 
24 examination administered by a national council of landscape architectural 
25 registration boards or an equivalent examination specified by board rule and:
26 (a)  The applicant has completed a course of study in a school or college of 
27 landscape architecture approved by the board, with graduation evidenced by a 
28 diploma setting forth a satisfactory degree, and  2 years of practical experience 
29 in landscape architectural work of a grade and character satisfactory to  as 
30 prescribed by the board  by rule; or
31 (b)  The applicant has training or practical experience, or a combination of 
32 both, that in the opinion of the board is fully equivalent to that required in 
33 division (a).
34Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
35 takes effect when approved.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill aligns the licensure requirements for applicants for the landscape architect 
38 license with those for architects and removes the requirement that an applicant must 
39 complete both the education and experience requirements before being qualified to take the 
40 required examination.  The bill also authorizes the Maine State Board for Licensure of 
41 Architects, Landscape Architects and Interior Designers to specify by rule the required 37
