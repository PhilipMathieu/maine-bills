Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill provides free admission for members of federally recognized Indian nations, tribes and bands to state-owned
parks, historic sites, camping areas and beaches. This is estimated to reduce General Fund revenue by $22,131 in
fiscal year 2024-25 and $29,508 starting in fiscal year 2025-26. This estimate assumes that tribal members will use
state-owned parks, historic sites, camping areas and beaches at the same rate as Maine residents and nonresidents.
