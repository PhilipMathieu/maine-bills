24 SUMMARY
25 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
26 changes the title but maintains its emergency status. It stipulates that when a defendant
27 found incompetent to stand trial who is placed in a mental health unit of a correctional
28 facility petitions a court for retn-n to placement in a less restrictive setting, after a hearing
29 on that petition the court must return the defendant to a less restrictive setting if it finds by
3 0 clear and convincing evidence that the mental health unit of a correctional facility in which
31 the defendant is placed is not the least restrictive placement appropriate for the defendant,
32 The amendment also extends the sunset of the laws governing placement of certain
3 3 defendants found incompetent to stand trial in a mental health unit of a correctional facility
34 by 3 years to July 1,2027,
35 The amendment also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
36 establish a stakeholder group consisting of, at a minimum, the Commissioner of
37 Corrections or the commissioner's designee, a criminal defense attorney licensed m this
38 State and a representative of a statewide organization that advocates for civil liberties to
39 develop a process and procedure for safely and efficiently placing certain defendants found
40 incompetent to stand trial who pose a health or safety risk to Department of Health and
41 Human Services personnel and patients in the least restrictive setting possible, This process
42 must ensure that the due process rights of the defendant are protected. The stakeholder
43 group must submit a report by January 1, 2027 establishing a process and procedure,
