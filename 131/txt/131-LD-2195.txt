23 and whether the barrier was temporary or permanent.
242.  Response.  Within 60 days following receipt of the notice required by subsection 1, 
25 the owner of the place of public accommodation shall provide to the individual, in writing,

33 to the notice as required by subsection 2 and, within 60 days of providing a response, fails 
34 to remove or make substantial progress in removing the architectural barrier as required by
