2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §4594-I is enacted to read:
3§4594-I.  Notice of noncompliance; cure period
4 Notwithstanding subchapter 7 or any other provision of law to the contrary, prior to the 
5 individual's filing a civil action under section 4621 or filing a complaint with the 
6 commission pursuant to section 4611 based on the failure of the owner of a place of public 
7 accommodation to remove an architectural barrier in that place of public accommodation, 
8 the individual shall comply with the provisions of this section.  As used in this section, 
9 "architectural barrier" or "barrier" means a physical feature that limits or prevents a person 
10 with a disability from accessing a place of public accommodation to obtain the goods or 
11 services that are offered by the place of public accommodation and "owner" includes the 
12 operator, lessor or lessee of a place of public accommodation.
131.  Notice.  The individual shall provide notice to the owner of the place of public 
14 accommodation.  The notice must:
15 A.  Be in writing;
16 B.  Be delivered by regular mail;
17 C.  Contain a description of the architectural barrier specific enough to allow the owner 
18 to identify the barrier; and 
19 D.  Specify in detail the circumstances under which the individual was actually limited 
20 in or prevented from accessing the place of public accommodation, including the 
21 address of the place of public accommodation, the date of the limitation or prevention, 
22 whether the individual requested assistance with removal of the architectural barrier 
23 and whether the barrier was temporary or permanent.
242.  Response.  Within 60 days following receipt of the notice required by subsection 1, 
25 the owner of the place of public accommodation shall provide to the individual, in writing, 
26 delivered by regular mail, a description of the steps the owner plans to take to remove the 
27 architectural barrier.
283.  Removal of architectural barrier.  If the owner provides a response pursuant to 
29 subsection 2, within 60 days of providing the response, the owner shall remove or make 
30 substantial progress in removing the architectural barrier.
314.  Remedy.  If the individual meets the requirements of subsection 1 and the owner of 
32 the place of public accommodation, within 60 days of receipt of the notice, fails to respond 
33 to the notice as required by subsection 2 and, within 60 days of providing a response, fails 
34 to remove or make substantial progress in removing the architectural barrier as required by 
35 subsection 3, the individual may file a complaint or a civil action under section 4611 or 
36 4621.

39 or lessee of a place of public accommodation the opportunity to remove an architectural 
40 barrier to accessing a place of public accommodation to obtain goods or services by an

46 removing the barrier to access within 60 days after providing the response, the individual 
47 may file a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission or file a civil action in the
