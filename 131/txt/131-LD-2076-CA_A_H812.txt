No state fiscal impact

Minor savings - Municipalities
Tiscal Detail and Notes
As excise tax is collected and retained by municipalities, this bill has no State fiscal impact, Extending the exemption
to additional active duty service members will reduce municipal excise tax collections and repealing the requirement
to adopt an ordinance to provide an excise tax exemption will decrease muncipal costs. The municipal revenue and
cost impacts are expected to be minor.
