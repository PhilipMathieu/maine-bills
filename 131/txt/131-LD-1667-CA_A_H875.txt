The required.local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: ( 1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of ea.ch House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes a base allocation of $500 per year beginning in fiscal year 2024-25 to a newly created Maine Board 
of Place Names account within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services to allow acceptance and 
expenditure of funding from private and public sources. 
The bill also includes a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Maine Board of Place Names program of $1,650 in fiscal year 2024-25 to provide funds for per diem costs associated 
with meetings of the board. This amount assumes 3 members of the board are eligible for the per diem and the per 
diem is paid for 10 meetings in fiscal year 2024-25. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State, the Department of Administrative. and Financial 
Services, the University of Maine System, the Maine Historic Preservation Commission and the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry associated with serving on the Maine Board of Place Names are expected to 
·be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
