the program, the facility must be located in the State, meet requirements for a 100% clean 
hydrogen production tax credit under the federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and IRS 
production tax credit regulations, have a peak electricity demand of no more than 20

program, the commission is required to direct the transmission and distribution utility in 
whose territory the facility is located to negotiate with that facility for a special contract 
that may be approved by the commission. A facility selected for the program must meet 
specified wage requirements and meet clean hydrogen production volumes identified in the 
proposal it submits for participation in the program.
