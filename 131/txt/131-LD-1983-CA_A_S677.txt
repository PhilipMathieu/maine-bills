Requires local units of government to include a provision in procurement bids and

be'manufactured in the United States unless a waiver is received or certain
exceptions are met.

statewide
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.
Fiscal Detail and Notes
The Department of Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) has indicated it will require additional positions to
review all contracts and to implement and enforce a waiver process. The annual costs for 2 Procurement Analyst I
.positions and 2 Planning and Research Associate I positions would be approximately $380,000 starting in fiscal year
2024-25. As the bill requires DAFS administer the provisions of the bill within existing resources, no funding for
positions is included. What this may mean to DAFS cannot be determined at this time.
LR0080(02) - Fiscal Note - Page 1 of 2
The Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates increased project construction costs a§a result of decreased
competition from out-of-state contractors and in-state contractors who choose not to bid because of the additional
requirements and administrative costs associated with compliance with the requirements. The DOT will require a
Highway Fund allocation of $11,750,000 for All Other and Capital Expenditures funding beginning in fiscal year
2025-26 to cover these increased costs and another $447,984 for 2 EEO Program Analyst positions and 2 Procurement |
Analyst/Technician positions to implement, administer and ensure compliance with the Maine Buy American and |
Build Maine Act. It is noted that the original bill, which excluded DOT from its provisions, required DAFS to
administer the bill within its existing resources. The committee amendment removed the exclusion of DOT from the
bill but did not add DOT to the language requiring administration within existing resources. If the intent is that both
DAFS and DOT implement the bill within existing resources, it is most likely to require a reduction or postponement
of projects anticipated to be undertaken in order to remain within budgeted resources.
Requiring all procurement bids and subsequent contracts to contain a provision that the manufactured goods be
manufactured in the United States could increase costs to all state and other public agencies, including higher
educational institutions, county and municipal units of government and local school administrative units, if contracted |
goods currently manufactured by non-United States sources are less expensive than those manufactured in the United I
States and a waiver is not granted. The provision of the bill that provides for the Office of the Attorney General, upon
request within a 30 day period of contract award, to investigate and mediate grievances ofin-state contractors may
increase costs to the Office.
