Page 1 - 131LR3114(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, School Administrative District No. 52, referred to in this preamble as "the 
4 district," owns and operates a wastewater treatment plant in the Town of Turner for its 
5 school facilities and other private users; and
6Whereas, the Department of Environmental Protection authorized a project to replace 
7 the wastewater treatment plant with a new system with subsurface disposal to address 
8 overboard discharge affecting the Nezinscot River; and
9Whereas, the voters of the district authorized the issuance of up to $1,612,000 in 
10 bonds to fund the wastewater treatment project; and
11Whereas, on March 31, 2021, the district issued a temporary note in the principal 
12 amount of $1,612,000 through the State's Clean Water State Revolving Fund to provide 
13 temporary financing for the wastewater treatment project through project completion; and
14Whereas, the wastewater treatment project has been unexpectedly delayed due to the 
15 COVID-19 emergency and difficulties locating a suitable site for subsurface disposal and 
16 is not expected to be completed until August 2025; and
17Whereas, under state law, temporary notes issued by the district must mature not later 
18 than 3 years from the date the first temporary note is issued; and
19Whereas, under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, the district may not issue 
20 long-term bonds for the project until the project is completed; and
21Whereas, the unexpected delays have made it necessary for the district to issue 
22 temporary notes later than 3 years from the date the first temporary note was issued; and
23Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
24 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
25 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
26 therefore,
27Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
28Sec. 1.  Validation and authorization. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised 
29 Statutes, Title 20-A, section 1311, subsection 3, paragraph C, School Administrative

32 as necessary to finance a project authorized by the Department of Environmental Protection 
33 to replace the wastewater treatment plant with a new system with subsurface disposal in 
34 the Town of Turner.  The district may, as necessary, issue refunding notes or renewal notes 
35 pursuant to this section.  Any refunding notes or renewal notes issued pursuant to this 
36 section must meet the same requirements applicable to temporary notes as described in this 
37 section.
38Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
39 takes effect when approved.
