Fiscal Detail and Notes
131st MAINE LEGISLATURE
This bill exempts a manufacturer of insulin that is a nonprofit organization from paying the $75,000 registration fee. It 
is unclear whether any such organizations currently manufacture insulin, but manufacturers of 500,000 units or less 
are already exempt from the fee. Any decrease in dedicated revenue to the Maine Board of Pharmacy within the 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation cannot be determined at this time.
Any additional costs to the Maine Health Data Organization from the provisions of this bill are expected to be minor 
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
