8Sec. 2.  17 MRSA §317-A, sub-§1, ¶F, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. JJJJJ, 
9 §20, is further amended to read:
10 F.  Issue a subpoena in the name of the Gambling Control Unit in accordance with Title 
11 5, section 9060, except that this authority applies to any stage of an investigation under 
12 this chapter and is not limited to an adjudicatory hearing.  This authority may not be 
13 used in the absence of reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred.  If a witness 
14 refuses to obey a subpoena or to give any evidence relevant to proper inquiry by the 
15 unit, the Attorney General may petition the Superior Court in the county where the 
16 refusal occurred to find the witness in contempt.  The Attorney General shall cause to 
17 be served on that witness an order requiring the witness to appear before the Superior 
18 Court to show cause why the witness should not be adjudged in contempt.  The court 
19 shall, in a summary manner, hear the evidence and, if it is such as to warrant the court 
20 in doing so, punish that witness in the same manner and to the same extent as for 
21 contempt committed before the Superior Court or with reference to the process of the 
22 Superior Court. ; and
23Sec. 3.  17 MRSA §317-A, sub-§1, ¶G is enacted to read:

27 Control Unit prescribed by authority of this chapter.
28 The Gambling Control Unit shall notify the licensee or registrant in writing that a fine 
29 is imposed pursuant to this paragraph and of the right to a hearing pursuant to this 
30 paragraph. The licensee or registrant has the right to request a hearing before the 
31 Commissioner of Public Safety or the commissioner's designee. Upon the licensee's or 
32 registrant's request for a hearing, the Commissioner of Public Safety shall provide a 
33 hearing. The hearing must comply with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act. The 
34 purpose of the hearing is to determine whether a preponderance of the evidence 
35 establishes that the licensee or registrant or the licensee's or registrant's agent or 
36 employee violated a provision of this chapter or a rule of the Gambling Control Unit 
37 prescribed by authority of this chapter. A request for a hearing may not be made any 
38 later than 10 days after the licensee or registrant is notified of the fine. The imposition

42 shown.

46 may be entered into only with the consent of the licensee or registrant or the licensee's

32 §29, is further amended to read:

34 9060, except that this authority applies to any stage of an investigation under this 
35 chapter and is not limited to an adjudicatory hearing.  This authority may not be used 
36 in the absence of reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred.  If a witness 
37 refuses to obey a subpoena or to give any evidence relevant to proper inquiry by the 
38 unit, the Attorney General may petition the Superior Court in the county where the 
39 refusal occurred to find the witness in contempt.  The Attorney General shall cause to
