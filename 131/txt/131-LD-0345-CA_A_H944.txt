The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: ( 1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill transfers the responsibility for child find activities and F APE for children ages 3 th1;ough 5 who are eligible 
for services under the Individuals with Disabilities Act, Part B, Section 619 from the State to local school 
administrative units (SAUs) effective July 1, 2028. The bill requires the Department of Education to implement a 
funding fotmula, separate from the Essential Program and Services model, to fully fund the cost for SA Us to assurri" 
the responsibility for FAPE and child find activities, The cost to the State to fund 100% of the cost to SAUs once 
transition is complete in July of 2028 cannot be estimated at this time but will be significant.

Commissioner of Education, The Department of Education will provide those approved SAU's with professional
