into account the exercise of due diligence. 
A comt may not consider either the general congestion of the comt's calendar or lack of 
diligent preparation on the pait of the attorney for the State as factors weighing in favor of

26 number to read consecutively. 
27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. The 
29 amendment retains the subject matter of the bill but lengthens the maximum time period 
30 before a criminal trial must commence, referred to in this summary as "the speedy trial 
31 deadline," and eliminates the distinction between the speedy trial deadline for defendants 
32 who are and defendants who are not in custody. Beginning with cases brought on or from 
33 January 1, 2026, the trial for a defendant charged with murder or a Class A crime must 
34 commence within 24 months from arraignment, the trial for a defendant charged with a 
3 5 Class B or Class C crime must commence within 15 months from arraignment and the trial 
3 6 for a defendant charged with a Class D or Class E crime must commence within 12 months 
37 from arraignment. The amendment also phases in, on January 1, 2028 and again on January 
3 8 1, 203 0, reductions in the speedy trial deadlines fo1· defendants charged with Class B, Class 
39 C, Class Dor Class E crimes. 
40 The amendment adds to the list of activities leading to delays in the commencement of 
41 a criminal trial that must be excluded in computing whether the trial has commenced within 
42 the speedy tdal deadline and authorizes the court to grant a motion to enlarge the speedy

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT"{>( to H.P. 1135, L.D. I 771 
trial deadline when the interests of justice served by granting the enlargement of time 
outvveigh the interests of the public and of the defendant in a speedy trial. Unlike the bill, 
the amendment provides that, if the speedy trial deadline is not met, the court has a choice 
to dismiss the case with or without prejudice after providing the defendant and the attorney 
for the State notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue. In deciding whether the 
dismissal should be with or without prejudice, the cou11 must consider the seriousness of 
the alleged offense, the facts and circumstances leading to the delay of the trial, the viability 
of prosecuting the case again, any objection of a victim of the alleged offense and any other 
relevant factor. 
The amendment also incorporates a fiscal note and adds an appropriations and 
allocations section. The fiscal note identifies the amendment as creating a potential state 
mandate because counties may need to hire additional staff to meet the speedy trial 
deadlines set fo11h in the amendment. To qualify as a state mandate pursuant to the 
Constitution of Maine, legislation must require a local unit of govemment to expand or 
modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. After 
consulting with the Attorney General, the members of the committee voting in favor of the 
majority rep011 have determined that this legislation is not a mandate. While it may be best 
practice for a county, in its discretion, to expend additional local revenue to hire additional 
staff to supp011 the work of the state-funded Assistant District Attorney positions 
established in the amendment, the amendment does not affirmatively require counties to 
expend additional local revenues for this purpose. In addition, A11icle I, Section 6 of the 
Constitution of Maine and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution grant 
criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial, a right state and local government are already 
required to uphold.

The requireq. local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriatio11s be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requireme11t. If the bill does represe11t a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes time limits for the commencement of criminal trials under the new Maine Speedy Trial Act. The 
bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations to the District Attorneys Salary Program within the Office of the 
Attorney General of $777,956 in fiscal year 2024-25 to establish 12 Assistant District Attorney positions effective 
January 1, 2025, to handle the increased worldoad across the State's 8 prosecutorial districts to meet the time limits in 
the bill.
