29 SUMMARY 
30 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment enacts the 
31 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact to facilitate the interstate practice of dentist1y and 
32 dental hygiene by improving public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services

34 are not licensed. The compact preserves the regulatory authority of a state to protect public 
3 5 health and safety through that state's current system of state licensure and promote mobility 
3 6 and address workforce shortages by eliminating the necessity for licenses in multiple states 
37 by providing fol' the n.rntual recognition of other member state licenses. 
3 8 The form, fo11nat and text of the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact have been 
39 changed minimally so as to conform to Maine statut01y conventions, The changes are

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation adds the State of Maine to the Compact for Licensing Dentists and Dental Hygienists contingent upon 
7 states enacting it into law. This fiscal note assumes that at least 7 states will enact the compact and it will become 
effective during the 2024-25 fiscal year, 
Given this assumption, this bill includes ongoing Other Special Revenue Funds allocations totaling $219,341 in fiscal 
year 2024-25 to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation (DPFR) to join and participate in the dentist 
and dental hygienists compact. Of that amount, $204,352 is allocated to the Office of Professional and Occupational 
Regulation (OPOR) for one Comprehensive Health Plantier II position and one Health Services Consultant.position 
and related All Other costs to manage the increase in responsibilities of the Board of Dental Practice, including the 
review of applications fo1· compact privilege, compact compliance, joint investigations and reporting requirements. 
Additionally, $5,753 is allocated to OPOR for STA-CAP and rulemaking costs, Finally, $9,236 is allocated on an 
ongoing basis to the Administrative Services - Professional and Financial Regulation program within DPFR for STA­
CAP, service center support and technology costs that are reimbursed by transfers from the board, 
According to DPFR, the Board of Dental Practice does not have sufficient resources to supp01t the costs associated 
with this bill within the amount of revenue currently received and will need to increase fees to suppott the additonal 
costs.
