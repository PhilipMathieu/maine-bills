Fiscal Detail and Notes
Prior to an emergency rule to Chapter 101: IVIaine Unified Special Education Regulation Birth to Age Twenty-two,
implemented by the Department of Education on July 7, 2023, school administrative units (SAUs) were required to
pay special purpose private schools (SPPS) a daily rate for program participation on days when students actually
attended their programming, The emergency rule changed this provision to require SAUs to pay the daily rate to
SPPS regardless of whether the student is actually in attendance on a given school day. The department estimates the
additional costs to SAUs to be approximately $90 - $135 per student per program day, The total cost to SAU's can not
be determined at this time, According to the Department of Education, SAUs that report additional funds spent in the
current school year, specifically on High Cost Out-of-District placements in SPPS, above what was allocated to the
SAU in the essential programs and services funding model receive a subsidy adjustment in the spring of the same
school year to cover the additional costs,
