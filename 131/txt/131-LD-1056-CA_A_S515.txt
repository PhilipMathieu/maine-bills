21 SUMMARY
22 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces
23 the bill.
24 Part A of the amendment clarifies that a person upon whom a grand jury subpoena is
25 served may notify others of the existence of the subpoena unless a court issues an order
26 prohibiting notice to any person on the basis that there is a reason to believe such notice
27 will have an adverse result. It also requires an attorney for the State, within one year after
28 service of a grand jury subpoena, to notify the subject of the subpoena against whom an
29 indictment has not been issued of the existence of the subpoena unless a court enters an
30 order waiving the notice requirement on the basis that there is a reason to believe such
31 notice will have an adverse result. For purposes of these provisions, the amendment defmes
32 "adverse result" as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person;
33 flight from prosecution; destruction of or tampering with evidence; intimidation of a
34 potential witness; seriously jeopardizing an investigation; or undue delay of a trial.
35 Part B of the amendment amends the provisions of law that require state and local
36 government entities to obtam a search warrant, unless certain enumerated circumstances
37 exist, before accessing information regarding the content of portable electronic device
38 communications. Part B expands the scope of these laws to apply when state or local
39 government entities seek to obtain not only infonnation about the content of
40 communications but also metadata about those communications and any other information
41 stored on, generated by or transmitted through operation of an electronic device, regardless
42 of whether it is portable. Part B also clarifies that these provisions of law apply when state
