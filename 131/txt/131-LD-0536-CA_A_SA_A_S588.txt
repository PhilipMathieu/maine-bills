This amendment removes the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services and 
eliminates the Environmental Specialist III position that was in the bill to handle new administrative oversight 
responsibilities. These are no longer required due to the approval of a position in PL 2023, c. 412 which will be 
dedicated part-time to cemete1y and crematoria oversight.
