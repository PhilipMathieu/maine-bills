2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §3314, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. C, §50, is 
3 further amended to read:
46.  Forfeiture of firearms.  As part of every disposition in every proceeding under this 
5 code, every firearm that constitutes the basis for an adjudication for a juvenile crime that, 
6 if committed by an adult, would constitute a violation of section 393; Title 17‑A, section 
7 1105‑A, subsection 1, paragraph C‑1; Title 17‑A, section 1105‑B, subsection 1, paragraph 
8 C; Title 17‑A, section 1105‑C, subsection 1, paragraph C‑1; Title 17‑A, section 1105‑D, 
9 subsection 1, paragraph B‑1; or Title 17‑A, section 1118‑A, subsection 1, paragraph B and 
10 every firearm used by the juvenile or any accomplice during the course of conduct for 
11 which the juvenile has been adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime that would 
12 have been forfeited pursuant to Title 17‑A, section 1504 if the criminal conduct had been 
13 committed by an adult must be forfeited to the State and the juvenile court shall so order 
14 unless another person satisfies the court prior to the dispositional hearing and by a 
15 preponderance of the evidence that the other person had a right to possess the firearm, to 
16 the exclusion of the juvenile, at the time of the conduct that constitutes the juvenile crime , 
17 was the rightful owner from whom the firearm had been stolen and the other person was 
18 not a principal or accomplice in the commission of the juvenile crime.  Rules adopted by 
19 the Attorney General that govern the disposition of firearms forfeited pursuant to Title 
20 17‑A, section 1504 govern forfeitures under this subsection.
21Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §5826, sub-§5, ¶A, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 421, §1, is 
22 amended to read:
23 A.  The   Except as provided in Title 17-A, section 1504, subsection 2, paragraph B, the 
24 petitioner has a legal right, title or interest in the property and the right, title or interest 
25 renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title or 
26 interest was vested in the petitioner rather than in any defendant or was superior to any 
27 right, title or interest to the exclusion of any defendant at the time of the commission 
28 of the acts that gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or
29Sec. 3.  17-A MRSA §1504, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
30 amended to read:
312.  Prohibited forfeiture.   Except as provided in subsection 3, a  A court may not order 
32 the forfeiture of a firearm otherwise qualifying for forfeiture under subsection 1 if, prior to 
33 the imposition of the person's sentence:
34 A.  For a crime other than murder or any other unlawful homicide crime, another person 
35 satisfies the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the other person, at the time 
36 of the commission of the crime, had a right to possess the firearm to the exclusion of 
37 the convicted person; or
38 B.  For the crime of murder or any other unlawful homicide crime, another  Another 
39 person satisfies the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the other person, at 
40 the time of the commission of the crime, was the rightful owner from whom the firearm 
41 had been stolen and the other person was not a principal or accomplice in the 
42 commission of the crime.
Page 2 - 131LR2831(01)1Sec. 4.  17-A MRSA §1504, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
2 repealed.
3Sec. 5.  17-A MRSA §1504, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
4 amended to read:
54.  Disposition of forfeited firearms.   The Attorney General shall adopt rules 
6 governing the disposition to state, county and municipal agencies of firearms forfeited 
7 under this section.  A firearm used during a murder or other unlawful homicide crime  
8 forfeited under this section that does not meet the prohibition from forfeiture under 
9 subsection 2, paragraph B must be destroyed by the State.
10SUMMARY
11 This bill amends the law governing the disposition of firearms that have been forfeited 
12 to the State as a mandatory part of a criminal sentence under the general sentencing 
13 provisions of the Maine Criminal Code. Current law requires that forfeited firearms used 
14 in commission of a murder or unlawful homicide crime be destroyed by the State. The bill 
15 extends the requirement to all firearms that have been forfeited as mandated by the general 
16 sentencing provisions of the Maine Criminal Code. The bill also eliminates one of the 
17 exceptions to mandatory forfeiture applying to cases in which the firearm subject to 
18 forfeiture is rightfully owned by another person. The bill amends the provision of law 
19 governing forfeiture of firearms within the Maine Juvenile Code to align with the general 
20 sentencing provisions as amended by this bill. Finally, the bill amends the relevant asset 
21 forfeiture laws to align with the narrowed exception for 3rd-party claims to firearms subject 
22 to forfeiture as provided by this bill.11
