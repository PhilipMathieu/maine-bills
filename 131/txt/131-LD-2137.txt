2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to enact the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact to facilitate the 
6 interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene by improving public access to dentistry 
7 and dental hygiene services provided by dentists and dental hygienists practicing in states 
8 in which they are not licensed. The compact preserves the regulatory authority of a state to 
9 protect public health and safety through that state's current system of state licensure and 
10 promote mobility and address workforce shortages by eliminating the necessity for licenses 
11 in multiple states by providing for the mutual recognition of other member state licenses.  
12 The verbatim text of the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact, which has not been 
13 edited to make necessary, nonsubstantive changes to conform to Maine legislative drafting 
14 standards, reads as follows.
15DENTIST AND DENTAL HYGIENIST COMPACT
16SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
17 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. The 
18 purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and dental 
19 hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing 
20 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the ability to practice in 
21 Participating States in which they are not licensed. The Compact does this by establishing 
22 a pathway for a Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to obtain a 
23 Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in another Participating State in which 
24 they are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health 
25 and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental Hygienists, through the 
26 State's authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The 
27 Compact: 
28 A.  Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact Privilege to 
29 practice in other Participating States without satisfying burdensome and 
30 duplicative requirements associated with securing a License to practice in those 
31 States;
32 B.   Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each Participating 
33 State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in that State;
34 C.  Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and Dental Hygienists by 
35 creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for Licensees to practice in 
36 Participating States.
37 D.   Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the public's health and safety;
38 E.   Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a Participating State;
39 F.   Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among 
40 Participating States;
4
Page 2 - 131LR2881(01)
1 G.  Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a Participating State 
2 pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within the Scope of Practice authorized 
3 in that State;
4 H.  Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the practice of dentistry 
5 and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists and Dental Hygienists who 
6 practice in the State through a Compact Privilege;
7 I.    Promotes the cooperation of Participating State in regulating the practice of 
8 dentistry and dental hygiene within those States;

4 11. Report to the Commission when applying for a Compact Privilege the address of

8 record with the Commission with respect to any action brought against the Licensee

11 Commission with respect to any action brought or investigation conducted by the 
12 Commission or a Participating State.
13 B.  The Licensee must comply with the requirements of subsection A of this section to 
14 maintain the Compact Privilege in the Remote State. If those requirements are met, the 
15 Compact Privilege will continue as long as the Licensee maintains a Qualifying 
16 License in the State through which the Licensee applied for the Compact Privilege and 
17 pays any applicable Compact Privilege renewal fees.
18 C.  A Licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene in a Remote State under the Compact 
19 Privilege shall function within the Scope of Practice authorized by the Remote State 
20 for a Dentist or Dental Hygienist licensed in that State.
21 D.  A Licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene pursuant to a Compact Privilege in a 
22 Remote State is subject to that State's regulatory authority. A Remote State may, in 
23 accordance with due process and that State's laws, by Adverse Action revoke or remove 
24 a Licensee's Compact Privilege in the Remote State for a specific period of time and 
25 impose fines or take any other necessary actions to protect the health and safety of its 
26 citizens. If a Remote State imposes an Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege that 
27 limits the Compact Privilege, that Adverse Action applies to all Compact Privileges in 
28 all Remote States. A Licensee whose Compact Privilege in a Remote State is removed 
29 for a specified period of time is not eligible for a Compact Privilege in any other 
30 Remote State until the specific time for removal of the Compact Privilege has passed 
31 and all encumbrance requirements are satisfied.
32 E.  If a License in a Participating State is an Encumbered License, the Licensee shall lose 
33 the Compact Privilege in a Remote State and shall not be eligible for a Compact 
34 Privilege in any Remote State until the License is no longer encumbered.

39 the individual shall lose or be ineligible for the Compact Privilege in any Remote State 
40 until the following occur:
41 1.  The specific period of time for which the Compact Privilege was removed has 
42 ended; and
43 2.  All conditions for removal of the Compact Privilege have been satisfied.
Page 7 - 131LR2881(01)
1 H.  Once the requirements of subsection G of this section have been met, the Licensee must 
2 meet the requirements in subsection A of this section to obtain a Compact Privilege in 
3 a Remote State.
4SECTION 5. ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBER OR THEIR SPOUSES
5 An Active Military Member and their spouse shall not be required to pay to the 
6 Commission for a Compact Privilege the fee otherwise charged by the Commission. If a 
7 Remote State chooses to charge a fee for a Compact Privilege, it may choose to charge a 
8 reduced fee or no fee to an Active Military Member and their spouse for a Compact 
9 Privilege.
10SECTION 6. ADVERSE ACTIONS
11 A.  A Participating State in which a Licensee is licensed shall have exclusive authority to 
12 impose Adverse Action against the Qualifying License issued by that Participating 
13 State.
14 B.  A Participating State may take Adverse Action based on the Significant Investigative 
15 Information of a Remote State, so long as the Participating State follows its own 
16 procedures for imposing Adverse Action.
17 C.  Nothing in this Compact shall override a Participating State's decision that participation 
18 in an Alternative Program may be used in lieu of Adverse Action and that such 
19 participation shall remain non-public if required by the Participating State's laws. 
20 Participating States must require Licensees who enter any Alternative Program in lieu 
21 of discipline to agree not to practice pursuant to a Compact Privilege in any other 
22 Participating State during the term of the Alternative Program without prior 
23 authorization from such other Participating State.
24 D.  Any Participating State in which a Licensee is applying to practice or is practicing 
25 pursuant to a Compact Privilege may investigate actual or alleged violations of the 
26 statutes and regulations authorizing the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in any 
27 other Participating State in which the Dentist or Dental Hygienist holds a License or 
28 Compact Privilege.
29 E.  A Remote State shall have the authority to:
30 1.  Take Adverse Actions as set forth in Section 4.D against a Licensee's Compact 
31 Privilege in the State;
32 2.  In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the Compact and the 
33 Commission's Rules issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that 
34 require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. 
35 Subpoenas issued by a State Licensing Authority in a Participating State for the 
36 attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of evidence from another 
37 Participating State, shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of competent 
38 jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to 
39 subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay 
40 any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service 
41 statutes of the State where the witnesses or evidence are located; and
Page 8 - 131LR2881(01)
1 3.  If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the Licensee the costs of 
2 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken 
3 against that Licensee.
4 F.  Joint Investigations
5 1.  In addition to the authority granted to a Participating State by its Dentist or Dental 
6 Hygienist licensure act or other applicable State law, a Participating State may 
7 jointly investigate Licensees with other Participating States.
8 2.  Participating States shall share any Significant Investigative Information, litigation, 
9 or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation 
10 initiated under the Compact.
11 G.  Authority to Continue Investigation
12 1.  After a Licensee's Compact Privilege in a Remote State is terminated, the Remote 
13 State may continue an investigation of the Licensee that began when the Licensee 
14 had a Compact Privilege in that Remote State.
15 2.  If the investigation yields what would be Significant Investigative Information had 
16 the Licensee continued to have a Compact Privilege in that Remote State, the 
17 Remote State shall report the presence of such information to the Data System as 
18 required by Section 8.B.6 as if it was Significant Investigative Information.
19SECTION 7. ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION.
20 A.  The Compact Participating States hereby create and establish a joint government 
21 agency whose membership consists of all Participating States that have enacted the 
22 Compact. The Commission is an instrumentality of the Participating States acting 
23 jointly and not an instrumentality of any one State. The Commission shall come into 
24 existence on or after the effective date of the Compact as set forth in Section 11A.

11 of review.
12 B.  The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Participating State,

8 documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be

11 Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at 
12 hearings required by this section.
13 K.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take final action on the 
14 proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.

19 were recommended by commenters.
20 3.  The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except 
21 for an emergency as provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule shall

38 be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject tochallenge 
39 by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be 
40 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A 
41 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of 
42 the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further 
Page 17 - 131LR2881(01)
43 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the

15 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
16 3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding 
17 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule

20 as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
21 B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
22 1.  If the Commission determines that a Participating State has defaulted in the 
23 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the

26 the default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 
27 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
28 2.  The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other 
29 Participating States.

31 from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and 
32 all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be 
33 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve 
34 the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
35 D.  Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means 
36 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate

6 date of said notice of termination.

8 or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between 
9 the Commission and the defaulting State.

27 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 
28 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 
29 litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the

6 so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the 
7 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the 
8 promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking 
9 authority solely for those purposes.
10 B.  The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence 
11 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary 
12 to the constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking participation in the 
13 Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, 
14 agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent

17 C.  Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may deny a State's 
18 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, 
19 terminate a Participating State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a 
20 constitutional requirement of a Participating State is a material departure from the 
21 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of 
22 any Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the 
23 remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to the Participating State 
24 affected as to all severable matters.
25SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
