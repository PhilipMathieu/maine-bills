1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services has been slow to finalize 
4 contracts with and make payments to behavioral health services providers and housing 
5 assistance providers under the Bridging Rental Assistance Program and the federal shelter 
6 plus care program; and
7Whereas, the department relies on these providers to provide services; and
8Whereas, delays in contract awards, finalization and payments have required 
9 providers to access loans or lines of credit to bridge temporary financial gaps; and
10Whereas, without timely payments from the department, providers must pay 
11 expenses, including rent to landlords for housing, out of the provider's own line of credit, 
12 which can create cash flow challenges that threaten the provider's solvency; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  34-B MRSA §3012 is enacted to read:

21 The department shall pay administrative expenses and interest charged on lines of 
22 credit or loans accessed by behavioral health services providers and housing assistance 
23 providers when a delay in awarding, finalization or payment of a department contract 
24 requires the provider to access the line of credit or loan.  For purposes of this section, 
25 "housing assistance providers" include the Bridging Rental Assistance Program established 
26 in section 3011 and the federal shelter plus care program authorized by the federal 
27 McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, Public Law 100-77 (1987) as amended by the 
28 federal Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009, 
29 Public Law 111-22, Division B (2009).

31 takes effect when approved.
