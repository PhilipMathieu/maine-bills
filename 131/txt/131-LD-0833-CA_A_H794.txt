SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the bill title, establishes separate committees for a Governor­
elect's inauguration and for the transition to office of a Governor-elect and prohibits the 
commingling of any donations received by one committee with donations received by the 
other committee. Under current law, a person is allowed to establish one committee to 
fund both types of activities. The amendment also limits a person's donation to each 
committee to no more in aggregate than the amount an individual may contribute to a 
gubernatorial candidate under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 1015, 
subsection 1. It also authorizes the transfer of funds from the Governor-elect's Expense 
Account to a committee established for the purpose of financing costs related to the 
transition to office of a Governor-elect.
