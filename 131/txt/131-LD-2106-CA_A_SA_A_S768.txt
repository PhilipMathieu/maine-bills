Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment reduces the ongoing revenue loss in the bill by removing the provision that accelerated the timeline 
for claiming the historic property rehabilitation tax credit and by modifying the maximum tax credit allowed. The 
revenue loss is eliminated in fiscal year 2024-25 and is reduced substantially in subsequent fiscal years. In fiscal year 
2024-25, the General Fund revenue loss is reduced by $95,000 to $0 and the Local Government Fund revenue loss is 
reduced by $5,000 to $0.
