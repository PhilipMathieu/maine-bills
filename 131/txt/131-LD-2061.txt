1Preamble. The Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 23 requires that real estate 
2 held by the State for conservation or recreation purposes may not be reduced or its uses 
3 substantially altered except on the vote of 2/3 of all members elected to each House.
4Whereas, certain real estate authorized for conveyance by this resolve is under the 
5 designations described in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 598-A; and
6Whereas, the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of 
7 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may sell or exchange lands with the approval of 
8 the Legislature in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 1814; now, 
9 therefore, be it
10Sec. 1. Director of Bureau of Parks and Lands authorized to convey certain 
11land known as Peacock Beach State Park.  Resolved:  That the Director of the 
12 Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
13 Forestry may gift by quitclaim deed without covenant, and on such other terms and 
14 conditions as the director may direct, all the State's interest in a parcel of land 
15 approximately 32 acres in size in Richmond known as Peacock Beach State Park, together 
16 with the buildings and improvements, and all the appurtenant rights and easements located 
17 on that property, which is currently the subject of a 25-year lease between the Bureau of 
18 Parks and Lands and the Town of Richmond, to the Town of Richmond.
19Sec. 2. Restrictions.  Resolved:  That the instrument transferring the interests of 
20 the State in the property referenced in section 1 must include the following terms and 
21 restrictions:
22 1. The property must continue to be used and managed for noncommercial public 
23 recreational use as a public park, subject to the terms of the federal Land and Water 
24 Conservation Fund. If the property is used otherwise, title to the property automatically 
25 reverts to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, but only on those 
26 terms and conditions as the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands may direct;
27 2. If the Town of Richmond proposes to transfer an interest in the property, in whole 
28 or in part, to a 3rd party not affiliated with the Town of Richmond, the Department of 
29 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has a right of first refusal to take back the property 
30 at no cost and upon those terms and conditions as the Director of the Bureau of Parks and 
31 Lands may direct; and
32 3. Notwithstanding any decision by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
33 Forestry not to exercise its right of first refusal, the department continues to hold the right 
34 of first refusal in perpetuity, and this right is a servitude on the property and runs with the 
35 land and is binding upon the Town of Richmond and its successors and assigns forever.
