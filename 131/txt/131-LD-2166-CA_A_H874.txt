5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment changes the term used in the bill to refer to a grant applicant's program 
7 from "pilot program" to "program plan" and specifies that a student with an intellectual 
8 disability or developmental disability or autism spectrum disorder does not need to possess 
9 a high school diploma in order to be admitted to a program plan or to receive a scholarship. 
10 The amendment also makes changes to the provision of the bill that requires grant 
11 applicants to design their program plans to meet the requirements of a comprehensive 
12 transition and postsecondary program under federal law. The amendment clarifies that 
13 grant applicants should use the federal law as a model, but only to the extent practicable 
14 and only to the extent that the federal law does not conflict with any of the other provisions 
15 of the grant program established by the bill. The amendment also corrects citations to the 
16 federal law and removes the requirement that a program plan developed by an institution 
17 of higher education in this State be designed to allow students to qualify for federal grants 
18 and work-study programs.
