Fiscal Detail arid Notes
This bill reduces the excise tax per pound on cannabis products beginning January 1, 2025 and changes the excise tax
on cannabis products to 10% of the average wholesale price beginning January 1, 2027. In fiscal year 2024-25,
cannabis excise tax revenue will decrease by $4,282,000 and cannabis sales tax revenue will increase by $129,000,
resulting in a net decrease in General Fund revenue of $3,790,000. The increase in cannabis sales tax revenue results
from increased sales volume as prices decrease in response to lower excise taxes, which more than offsets the
negative impact of the price decrease on sales tax revenue.
The bill also reduces revenue to the Adult Use Cannabis Public Health and Safety and Municipal Opt-in Fund by
$368,000 in fiscal year 2024-25 and increases revenue to the Local Government Fund by $5,000 in fiscal year 2024-
25, resulting in a net reduction of $363,000 in Other Special Revenue Funds,
This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $130,476 starting in fiscal year 2024-25 to the Office of
Cannabis Policy withm the Department of Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) for one Auditor II position
and associated costs. Administrative costs to the Bureau of Revenue Services within DAFS to implement the changes
in the canuabis excise tax are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources,
