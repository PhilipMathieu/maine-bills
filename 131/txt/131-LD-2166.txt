26 program, the department awards competitive grants to institutions of higher education to 
27 develop and implement pilot programs that offer students with intellectual or 
28 developmental disabilities or autism spectrum disorder, to the greatest extent possible, the 
29 same rights, privileges, experiences, benefits and outcomes in a postsecondary education 
30 as students without disabilities. The bill requires that, in order to receive funding under the 
31 grant program, pilot programs developed by institutions of higher education meet the 
32 requirements of a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program under the federal 
33 Higher Education Opportunity Act so that students enrolled in the pilot program may be 
34 eligible for certain federal grants and work-study programs. The bill requires institutions 
35 of higher education to use 25% of the funds received through the grant program for 
36 scholarships for students participating in the pilot program. Finally, the bill requires 
37 institutions of higher education to make periodic reports to the department concerning the 
38 progress and sustainability of its pilot program and requires the department to annually 
39 report to the Legislature the effectiveness of the grant program.
