6 reasonably incurred, less the value of any property forfeited under section 1134. The court 
7 shall hold a hearing to determine the amount of the fine authorized by this subsection. In 
8 imposing a fine, the court shall consider the seriousness of the conduct, whether the amount 
9 of the fine is disproportionate to the conduct in which the person engaged, the impact of 
10 the conduct on victims and any legitimate enterprise involved in that conduct, as well as

19 of an innocent party.
204. Disposition of fine proceeds. The court shall apply fines collected under this section 
21 to the costs and expenses of investigation and prosecution, including costs of resources and

26 aggrieved person. Before the acceptance of a plea or after a verdict but before the

28 been duly effected or that a satisfactory explanation of why full restitution is impractical 
29 has been made to the court.

33 property subject to forfeiture under this section. Property subject to forfeiture is real 
34 property and personal property that was used in the course of, intended for use in the course 
35 of, derived from or realized through conduct in violation of section 1132. A court may not

1 (3)  That afforded the person a source of influence or control over the affairs of an 
2 enterprise that the person exercised in violation of section 1132;
3 B. Any compensation, right or benefit derived from a position, office, appointment, 
4 tenure, commission or employment contract described in paragraph A that accrued to 
5 the person during the period of conduct in violation of section 1132;
6 C. Any interest in an enterprise, any security of an enterprise, any claim against an 
7 enterprise or a property or contractual right affording the person a source of influence 
8 or control over the affairs of an enterprise that the person exercised in violation of 
9 section 1132; and
10 D. Any amount payable or paid under any contract for goods or services that was 
11 awarded or performed in violation of section 1132.
122. Other property of defendant. The court may order criminal forfeiture of any 
13 property other than property described under subsection 1 of the defendant up to the value

16 A. Cannot be located;
17 B. Has been sold to a bona fide purchaser for value;
18 C. Has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;

23§1135. Preservation of property subject to forfeiture
241. Temporary restraining order. When an indictment or complaint is filed under 
25 section 1132, the court may take any of the following actions if the prosecuting authority 
26 shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the action is necessary to preserve the 
27 reachability of property subject to criminal forfeiture:
28 A. Enter a restraining order or injunction;
29 B. Require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond; or
30 C. Take any other reasonable action, including the appointment of a receiver.
31 Before granting the remedies provided by this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing, 
32 after notice to all affected persons, giving them a reasonable opportunity to respond. At the 
33 hearing, the rules of evidence do not apply.
342. Preindictment order. The following provisions govern preindictment orders.
35 A. If an indictment or complaint has not been filed, the court may take actions provided 
36 in subsection 1 if the prosecuting authority makes the showing required by subsection 
37 1 and also shows that:
38 (1) There is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the 
39 order is sought would, in the event of a conviction, be subject to criminal forfeiture 
40 under section 1134; and
Page 5 - 131LR2862(01)
1 (2) The requested order would not result in substantial and irreparable harm or 
2 injury to the party against whom the order is to be entered, or to other affected 
3 persons, that outweighs the need to preserve the reachability of the property.
4 B. An order entered under this subsection is effective for a maximum of 90 days unless:
5 (1) Extended by the court for good cause; or
6 (2) Terminated by the filing of an indictment or complaint alleging that the 
7 property is subject to forfeiture.
83. Restraining order without notice. On application by the prosecuting authority, the 
9 court may grant, without notice to any party, a temporary restraining order to preserve the 
10 reachability of property subject to criminal forfeiture under section 1134 if:
11 A. An indictment or complaint alleging that property is subject to criminal forfeiture 
12 has been filed or the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that 
13 property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of a conviction, 
14 be subject to criminal forfeiture under section 1134;
15 B. The property is in the possession or control of the party against whom the order is 
16 to be entered; and
17 C. The court makes a specific finding in writing that the property can be concealed, 
18 disposed of or placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court before any party may be 
19 heard in opposition.
20 A temporary restraining order granted without notice to any party under this subsection 
21 expires within the time fixed by the court, not to exceed 10 days. The court may extend the 
22 order for good cause shown or if the party against whom it is entered consents to an 
23 extension. After a temporary restraining order is granted under this subsection, a hearing 
24 concerning the entry of an order under this section must be held at the earliest practicable 
25 time and before the temporary order expires.
26§1136. Disposition of forfeiture proceeds
271. Disposition alternatives. Except as provided in subsection 2, after making due 
28 provisions for the rights of innocent persons, the prosecuting authority shall, as soon as 
29 feasible, dispose of all property ordered forfeited under section 1134 by:
30 A. Public sale;
31 B. Sale or transfer to an innocent person; or
32 C. Destruction, if the property is not needed for evidence in a pending criminal or civil 
33 proceeding.

38 property or real property not exercisable by or transferable for value by the prosecuting 
39 authority expires and does not revert to the defendant. Forfeited property may not be 
40 purchased by the defendant, a relative of the defendant or any person acting in concert with 
41 the defendant or on the defendant's behalf.
Page 6 - 131LR2862(01)
14. Sale proceeds. The proceeds of a sale or other disposition of forfeited property under 
2 this section, whether by final judgment, settlement or otherwise, must be applied as 
3 follows:
4 A. To the fees and costs of the forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, 
5 maintenance and custody of the property pending its disposition, advertising and court 
6 costs; and
7 B. The balance to the Maine State Housing Authority to be used by the authority to pay 
8 taxes, fees and liens associated with real property transferred to the authority pursuant 
9 to subsection 2 and rehabilitate that real property into livable residential real property 
10 for resale.
11§1137. Additional relief available
12 With respect to property ordered forfeited, a fine imposed or a civil penalty imposed 
13 in a criminal proceeding under section 1132 or civil proceeding under section 1139, the 
14 court may, on petition of the prosecuting authority or any other person within 60 days of a 
15 final order:

251. Remedy not exclusive. Except as provided in this section, a criminal penalty, 
26 forfeiture or fine imposed under section 1132, 1133, 1134 or 1139 does not preclude the 
27 application of any other criminal penalty or civil remedy for the separate criminal acts. A 
28 prosecuting authority may not file a civil action under section 1139 if any prosecuting 
29 authority has filed a previous criminal proceeding under section 1132 against the same 
30 person based on the same criminal conduct and the charges were dismissed after jeopardy 
31 attached or the person was acquitted.
322. Restitution. A restitution payment to a victim under section 1133 does not limit 
33 liability for damages in a civil action or proceeding for an amount greater than the 
34 restitution payment.
35§1139. Civil remedies
361. Relief available. The prosecuting authority may institute civil proceedings in court 
37 seeking relief from conduct constituting a violation of section 1132 or to prevent or restrain 
38 future violations. If the prosecuting authority proves the alleged violation by a 
39 preponderance of the evidence, and the court has made due provision for the rights of 
40 innocent persons, the court may:
41 A. Order a defendant to divest an interest in an enterprise or in real property;
Page 7 - 131LR2862(01)

9 corporation to conduct business in this State if the court finds that:

11 in conducting the affairs of the corporation, authorized or engaged in conduct 
12 constituting a violation of section 1132; and
13 (2) The public interest in preventing future criminal conduct requires the action.
142. Injunctive relief. In a proceeding under this section, the court may grant injunctive 
15 relief.
163. Civil penalty. The prosecuting authority may institute proceedings against an 
17 enterprise or an individual to recover a civil penalty. The penalty may be imposed in the 
18 discretion of the court for conduct constituting a violation of section 1132. The civil penalty

23 Fund.
244. Attorney's fees. If the court issues an injunction or grants other relief under this 
25 section, or the prosecuting authority otherwise substantially prevails, the prosecuting 
26 authority must also recover reasonable attorney's fees in the trial and appellate courts and 
27 costs of investigation and litigation reasonably incurred.
285. Personal jurisdiction. Personal service of process in a proceeding under this section 
29 may be made on any person outside of this State if the person was a principal in any conduct 
30 constituting a violation of section 1132 in this State. The person is deemed to have 
31 submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State for the purposes of this section.
32§1140. Notice to other prosecuting authorities
33 When a prosecuting authority or law enforcement agency begins an investigation, files 
34 a charge or makes an arrest involving this chapter, the prosecuting authority or law 
35 enforcement agency shall notify the Department of the Attorney General. An office of a 
36 district attorney or a law enforcement agency is not required to obtain the permission of the 
37 Attorney General to conduct an investigation, file a charge or make an arrest involving this 
38 chapter. The Attorney General shall notify all prosecuting authorities and law enforcement 
39 agencies that are conducting investigations, filing charges or making arrests involving this 
40 chapter, the same actors and the same acts. The Attorney General shall designate the 
41 prosecuting authority or law enforcement agency that first filed notice of an investigation 
42 involving this chapter, the same actors and the same acts as the exclusive prosecuting 
Page 8 - 131LR2862(01)
43 authority or law enforcement agency for the matter under investigation if that prosecuting 
44 authority or law enforcement agency requests that designation.

14 in this subsection is met. If the residential building is in a municipality that has provided 
15 for electrical inspections, the person performing the work must apply to the municipal 
16 electrical inspector in writing for a permit. If the residential building is not in a municipality 
17 that has provided for electrical inspections, the person performing the work must apply to 
18 a state electrical inspector in writing for a permit. A municipal electrical inspector or state

25SUMMARY
26 This bill establishes the crime of racketeering and provides that a person is guilty of 
27 racketeering if the person is employed by or associated with an enterprise and intentionally 
28 conducts or participates in the affairs of the enterprise by participating in a pattern of 
29 criminal activity; acquires or maintains an interest in or control of an enterprise, or an 
30 interest in real property, by participating in a pattern of criminal activity; or participates in 
31 a pattern of criminal activity and knowingly invests any proceeds derived from that 
32 conduct, or any proceeds derived from the investment or use of those proceeds, in an 
33 enterprise or in real property. The bill defines "criminal act" as conduct constituting, or a 
34 conspiracy or attempt to commit, a violation punishable by imprisonment for one year or 
35 more of the criminal laws governing scheduled drugs. The definition of "criminal act" 
36 includes violations of the laws governing the aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs that 
37 involve the making, creating or manufacturing of scheduled drugs. It is an affirmative 
38 defense to a prosecution for racketeering that the person engaged in racketeering because 
39 the person is a trafficked person. A person guilty of racketeering commits a Class A crime 
40 for which a term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years or a fine of not more than
