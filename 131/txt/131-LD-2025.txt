2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §6502-C, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 640, §4, is amended 
3 to read:
42.  Licensed activity; commercial license.  The holder of a commercial menhaden 
5 fishing license may fish for, take, possess, ship, transport or sell menhaden that the holder 
6 has taken using the vessel named on the license. A commercial menhaden fishing license 
7 also authorizes the crew members aboard the vessel named on the license to fish for, take, 
8 possess, ship or transport menhaden when the license holder is aboard the vessel.
9Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §6502-C, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:
102-A.  License exception; illness, disability.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the 
11 commissioner may temporarily authorize an individual other than the holder of a 
12 commercial menhaden fishing license to fish for, take, possess, ship, transport or sell 
13 menhaden when the license holder is not present if the license holder documents to the 
14 commissioner that an illness or disability temporarily prevents the license holder from 
15 fishing for or taking menhaden and requests in writing to the commissioner that the 
16 commissioner authorize another holder of a commercial menhaden fishing license to fish 
17 for or take menhaden from the license holder's vessel or the vessel named on the  
18 temporarily authorized license holder's license.  The commissioner's authorization may 
19 require the temporarily authorized license holder to fish for, take, possess and land 
20 menhaden separately from the temporarily authorized license holder's own menhaden to 
21 ensure that harvest limits are not exceeded.  A temporary authorization granted by the 
22 commissioner to another license holder due to the illness or disability of the license holder 
23 may not exceed one menhaden fishing season.
24Sec. 3.  12 MRSA §6502-C, sub-§2-B is enacted to read:
252-B.  Exception to using the vessel named on the license holder's license for 
26commercial license holders.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the commissioner may 
27 temporarily authorize a holder of a commercial menhaden fishing license to use a vessel 
28 other than the vessel named on that license holder's license to fish for, take, possess, ship 
29 or transport menhaden if the license holder documents to the commissioner that the vessel 
30 named on that license holder's license has become temporarily inoperable because of an 
31 accident or a mechanical failure and requests in writing to the commissioner that the 
32 commissioner authorize the use of another vessel to fish for or take menhaden. The 
33 commissioner's authorization may require the license holder to fish for, take, possess and 
34 land menhaden separately from any menhaden taken under another license listing the same 
35 vessel to ensure that harvest limits are not exceeded. An authorization granted by the 
36 commissioner to a license holder due to an accident or a mechanical failure may not exceed 
37 2 weeks.  The commissioner may authorize one 2-week extension per license holder during 
38 the menhaden fishing season.
39Sec. 4.  12 MRSA §6502-C, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 640, §4, is amended 
40 to read:
413.  Licensed activity; noncommercial license.  The holder of a noncommercial 
42 menhaden fishing license may fish for, take or possess menhaden that the holder has taken 
43 using the vessel named on the license. A noncommercial menhaden fishing license 
Page 2 - 131LR2680(01)44 authorizes the crew members aboard the vessel named on the license to fish for, take or 
45 possess menhaden when the license holder is aboard the vessel.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill provides that the holder of a commercial menhaden fishing license may fish 
5 for, take, possess, ship, transport or sell menhaden that the holder has taken using only the 
6 vessel named on the license. The bill also provides 2 exceptions to this provision.  It allows 
7 a commercial menhaden license holder who is unable to fish for or take menhaden due to 
8 an illness or disability to request authorization from the Commissioner of Marine 
9 Resources and for the commissioner to grant the authorization for another commercial 
10 menhaden license holder to fish for or take menhaden on the ill or disabled license holder's 
11 behalf, and it allows a commercial menhaden license holder to request authorization to use 
12 a vessel other than the vessel identified on that license holder's license when that license 
13 holder's vessel is temporarily inoperable.
14 The bill also provides that the holder of a noncommercial menhaden fishing license 
15 may fish for, take or possess menhaden that the holder has taken using only the vessel 
16 named on the license.1
