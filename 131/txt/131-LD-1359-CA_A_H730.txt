Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements
The bill adds age to the list of sentencing factors to be considered by a court. Allowing age as a factor could reduce
the number of people incarcerated. It is unclear how many people would not be incarcerated who otherwise would
have been. The current average cost of incarcerating one individual for a single year is $55,203. No reduction in
funding has been included in the bill at this time.
