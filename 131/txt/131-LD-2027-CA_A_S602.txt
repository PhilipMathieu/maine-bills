This bill clarifies that a facility that stores spent nuclear fuel or certain radioactive waste does not qualify as an air
pollution control facility for the purposes of property tax exemption. The bill also clarifies that such a facility is not
eligible for property tax exemption under the Business Equipment Tax Exemption program and is not eligible for
property tax reimbursement under the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement program. This bill may increase
municipal tax revenue to the extent a facility that stores spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste currently benefits
from such tax exemption or reimbursement,
