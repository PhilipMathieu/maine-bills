28 notified by the court.
29 The abstract required by this subparagraph is confidential and is not a public record 
30 as defined in Title 1, chapter 13; however, the information contained in the abstract

36 is developed, request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ensure that, 
37 immediately after the order expires, the National Instant Criminal Background

39 subject of the order from possessing or acquiring a firearm.  For the purposes of 
40 this subsection, "criminal justice agency" means a federal, state, tribal, district, 
41 county or local government agency or any subunit of those entities that performs

44 justice.  Courts and the Department of the Attorney General are considered 
45 criminal justice agencies, as is any equivalent agency at any level of Canadian 
46 government.

1Sec. 19.  34-B MRSA §3862-A, sub-§8, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 411, Pt. A, §1 
2 and affected by Pt. D, §3, is amended to read:
38.  Offense.  Possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person is a Class D  C 
4 crime.
5SUMMARY
6 This bill does the following.
7 1.  It provides that a person may not own, possess or have under that person's control a 
8 firearm if that person is a restricted person under an order issued by another jurisdiction 
9 that is similar to an extreme risk protection order in this State. 
10 2.  It provides that a person may not recklessly sell or transfer a firearm to a person 
11 who is prohibited from owning, possessing or having under that person's control a firearm. 
12 3.  It changes the classification of the crime of recklessly, knowingly or intentionally 
13 selling or transferring a firearm to a person who is prohibited from owning, possessing or 
14 having under that person's control a firearm from a Class D to a Class C crime.
15 4.  It provides that a seller who is not a federally licensed firearms dealer and who 
16 transfers ownership of a firearm to a buyer may not complete the transaction unless the 
17 seller facilitates the transaction through a federally licensed firearms dealer.  The dealer 
18 must perform a background check of the putative buyer by using the Federal Bureau of 
19 Investigation, National Instant Criminal Background Check System in the same manner as 
20 if the dealer were the seller of the firearm that is the subject of the transaction.  If the 
21 background check reveals that the putative buyer is prohibited from purchasing a firearm, 
22 the dealer must notify the seller of that fact and of the fact that the transaction may not 
23 proceed.  The dealer may charge a reasonable fee for serving as the facilitator.  This 
24 provision applies only to transactions in which a seller sells a firearm to a buyer at a gun 
25 show or a seller sells a firearm to a buyer as a result of an advertisement, posting, display 
26 or other listing on the Internet or in a publication.  This provision does not apply to a 
27 transaction in which the buyer and seller are family members or a transaction for a firearm 
28 that is a curio or relic if the sale, transfer or exchange is between collectors of firearms as 
29 curios or relics who each have in their possession a valid collector of curios and relics 
30 license issued by the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
31 Firearms and Explosives or to a transaction for a firearm that is an antique firearm.
32 5.  It provides that if a law enforcement officer is unable to take a person into protective 
33 custody to conduct an assessment in connection with an extreme risk protection order, the 
34 law enforcement officer may apply for a protective custody warrant.  The officer must 
35 submit an affidavit of probable cause for a protective custody warrant to a Justice of the 
36 Superior Court or a Judge of the District Court.  The justice or judge must issue a protective 
37 custody warrant and promptly transmit that warrant to the officer for execution upon 
38 finding the affidavit is sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the person is 
39 mentally ill and due to that condition presents a likelihood of serious harm; probable cause 
40 to believe that the person possesses, controls or may acquire a dangerous weapon; and that 
41 the officer has made reasonable attempts to take the person into custody without a warrant.  
42 It also provides that an assessment performed in connection with an extreme risk protection 
43 order may be facilitated using telehealth technology.  It changes the required timing of 
44 certain events related to an extreme risk protection order.  It changes the classification of 
6
Page 9 - 131LR3066(01)
45 the crime of possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person from a Class D to a 
46 Class C crime.
3 6.  It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide injury and 
4 violence prevention programs, including data collection, synthesis and evaluation.
5 7.  It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to plan for and assist a 
6 statewide network of crisis receiving centers to provide immediate and short-term mental 
7 health and substance use disorder crisis stabilization services.
