Fiscal Note
Potential future biennium Legislative cost increase - General Fund
Legislative Cost/Study
Eliminating the repeal of the Institute could result in future year costs for the Legislature. The Legislature's 2024-2
biennial budget includes funding of $ 100,000 per year for the Institute that is one-time and will not be reflected in the
Legislature's 2026-2027 baseline budget. While some of the funds appropriated to date may carryover into future
years to fund the costs of the Institute, the Legislature will likely need 2026-2027 appropriations to fund the ongoing
costs of the Institute.
