This amendment strikes the ongoing General Fund appropriations of approximately $27.0 million per year to the 
General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program within the Department of Education beginning in fiscal year 2023-24 
included in the committee amendment and instead provides ongoing General Fund appropriations of $1.0 million per 
year beginning in fiscal year 2024-25 to a newly established Career and Technical Education - Direct Instruction 
program within the Department of Education to be distributed to career and technical education (CTE) centers and 
. CTE regions with fewer than 1,000 students in grade 9 through grade 12 within the CTE centers' or CTE regions' 
geographic boundaries to support the additional incremental costs of having one full-time instructor for every 8 
students enrolled in an approved program offered by the center or region. The cmTent funding model for career and 
technical education centers and career and technical education regions provides funding for one half-time instructor 
for approved programs that enroll less than 13 students.
