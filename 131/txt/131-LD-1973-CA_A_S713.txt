17 notice. A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with section 9605 to 
18 exercise the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal 
19 data as specified in subsection 1, paragraph E. In the case of processing personal data of a

30 consumer's requests, as long as the controller informs the consumer of the extension 
31 within the initial 45-day response period and of the reason for the extension. 
32 B. If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the 
33 controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than the 45th 
34 day after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and 
3 5 instructions for how to appeal the decision. 
36 C. The controller shall provide information in response to a consumer's request, free 
37 of charge, once during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are 
3 8 manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer 
39 a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or 
40 decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the 
41 manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.

notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to 
exercise the right until the consumer provides additional information reasonably 
necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request to exercise the right. 
E. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other 
than the consumer is in compliance with a consumer's request to delete that data 
pursuant to subsection I, paragraph C by retaining a record of the deletion request and 
the minimum data necessaiy for the purpose of ensuring that the consumer's personal 
data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained data for 
any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
4. Appeals. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the 
controller's inaction on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's 
receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to 
the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than 
the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of 
action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the 
reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the 
consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the 
consumer may contact the Attomey General to submit a complaint. 
§9605. Authorized agent 
A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, 
and act on the consumer's behalf, to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal 
data for the purposes specified in section 9604, subsection I, paragraph E, subparagraphs 
(1) and (2). The consumer may designate an authorized agent by way of, among other 
methods, technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a browser setting, 
browser extension or global device setting, indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of 
such processing. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an 
authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, using commercially reasonable effo1is, 
the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's 
behalf. 
§9606. Actions of controllers 
1. Data minimization. A controller must comply with the requirements of this 
subsection. 
A. A controller shall limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant 
and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as 
disclosed to the consumer. 
B. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller may not process personal 
data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessaty for, nor compatible with, the 
disclosed purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless 
the controller obtains the consumer's consent. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
controller's sale of sensitive data to one person or entity is neither necessary to nor 
compatible with the controller's sale of sensitive data to a different person or entity.

necessmy, adequate or relevant for each purpose for which data is processed, as 
disclosed to the consumer. 
D. A controller shall maintain documentation sufficient to demonstrate compliance 
with paragraphs A to C for as long as a processing activity continues and for a least 24 
months after the controller ceases to engage in the processing activity.

the consumer, or as otherwise permitted by this chapter or required by law; 
B. Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical 
data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of 
personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data;

a child, process the data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act of 1998, 15 United States Code, Section 6501 et seq., and the 
regulations, rules, guidance and exemptions adopted pursuant to that Act; and 
D. Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent

3. Prohibitions. A controller may not: 
A. Process sensitive data concerning a consumer unless the controller obtains the 
consumer's consent prior to processing. Consent is not valid under this paragraph 
unless the controller has disclosed:

(2) The reason consent is required, described in plain language that is 
understandable by a reasonable consumer; 
(3) The specific processing purposes for which consent is sought; 
( 4) The categories of sensitive data the controller must process to effectuate the 
processing purpose and the categories of personal data that will be processed with 
the sensitive data to effectuate the processing purpose; and 
(5) If applicable, the identity of all 3rd patties to whom the sensitive data may be 
sold. 
If a consumer has not interacted with a controller for a period of 24 months, the 
controller may not continue to process the consumer's sensitive data unless the 
controller obtains a new consent from the consumer in accordance with the 
requirements of this paragraph;

B. Process personal data in violation of the laws of this State and federal laws that 
prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers; 
C. When the controller, under the circumstances, has actual knowledge or willfully 
disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of 
age: 
(1) Process the personal data of the consumer for purposes of targeted adve1tising; 
or 
(2) Sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent; or 
D. Retaliate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right in this chapter or for 
not agreeing to the collection or processing of personal data for a separate product or 
service, including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for 
goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the 
consumer. 
4. Loyalty and rewards programs. A controller may offer a different price, rate, 
level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or 
services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntmy pa1ticipation 
in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program. 
5. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and 
meaningful privacy notice in plain language that is understandable by a reasonable 
consumer that includes: 
A. The categories of personal data processed by the controller; 
B. The purpose for processing personal data; 
C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights. including how a consumer 
may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request; 
D. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with 3rd patties, if any; 
E. The categories of 3rd patties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; 
and 
F. An active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact 
the controller. 
6. Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall 
describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit 
a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure 
and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact 
with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the 
ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A 
controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a 
consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. 
7. Notice of sale and targeted advertising; opt-out mechanism. If a controller sells 
personal data to a 3rd party or processes personal data for targeted adve1tising, the

4 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's 
5 personal data: and 
6 B. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Opt Me Out of Targeted Adve1iising 11 or bearing 
7 a substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs 
8 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables 
9 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of processing of the consumer's 
10 personal data for targeted adve1iising. 
11 In lieu of providing the 2 links described in paragraphs A and B, a controller may satisfy 
12 the requirements of this subsection by providing a single conspicuous and clearly labeled 
13 link on the controller's publicly accessible website that allows a consumer, or an agent of 
14 the consumer, both to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal data and to opt out of 
15 the processing of the consumer's personal data for targeted adve1iising. If the controller 
16 maintains a specific section or page of its publicly accessible website that allows a 
17 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's data or the 
18 processing of the consumer's data for targeted adve1iising and to select additional privacy 
19 controls, the controller may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by providing a single

26 signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platfonn, technology or mechanism to the 
27 controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. The 
28 platform, technology or mechanism: 
29 A. Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer; 
30 B. May not unfairly disadvantage another controller; 
31 C. May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to make an 
32 affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any such processing or 
33 sale of the consumer's personal data: 
34 D. Must be as consistent as possible with another similar platform, technology or 
3 5 mechanism required by federal or state law: and

3 7 resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt 
3 8 out of to the sale of the consumer's personal data or targeted adve1iising.

1. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a 
controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this 
chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include: 
A. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, so far as is reasonably 
practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request; 
B. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the 
processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation 
to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a 
breach of security, as defined in chapter 210-B, of the system of the processor, in order 
to meet the controller's obligations; and 
C. Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document 
data protection assessments. 
2. Contractual requirements. A contract between a controller and a processor must 
govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on 
behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data, 
the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of 
processing and the rights and obligations of both paiiies. The contract must require that the 
processor: 
A. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of 
confidentiality with respect to the data; 
B. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as 
requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data 
is required by law; 
C. On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all 
information in the processor's possession necessaiy to demonstrate the processor's 
compliance with the obligations in this chapter; 
D. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the 
controller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to 
conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational 
measures in suppo1t of the obligations in this chapter, using an appropriate and 
accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessment. 
The processor shall provide a repoti of the assessment to the controller upon request; 
and 
E. Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor 
to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data. 
3. Processing relationship liability. Nothing in this section may be construed to 
relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor 
by vi1tue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described 
in this chapter. 
4. Fact-based determination. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller 
or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that 
depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not

limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or 
who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a 
specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's 
instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a 
processor begins, alone or jointly with other persons, determining the purposes and means 
of the processing of personal data, the processor acts as a controller with respect to the 
processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 9612. 
§9608. Data protection assessments 
1. Documentation. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection 
assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk 
of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, "processing that presents a 
heightened risk of harm to a consumer" includes: 
A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; 
B. The sale of personal data; 
C. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling 
presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of: 
(1) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers; 
(2) Financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers; 
(3) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private 
affairs or concerns, of consumers, when the intrusion would be offensive to a 
reasonable person; or 
( 4) Other substantial injury to consumers; and 
D. The processing of sensitive data. 
2. Required elements. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection 
1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the 
processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the 
potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by 
safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall 
factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable 
expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship 
between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed. 
3. Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records. The Attorney 
General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant 
to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the 
data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may 
evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in 
this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under 
Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment 
disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege 
or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of that privilege or 
protection.

4. Processing activity. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable 
set of processing operations that include similar activities. 
5. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose 
of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment 
satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is 
reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would 
otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section. 
6. Application. A controller is not required to conduct a data protection assessment 
under this section for any processing activity created or initiated before July 1, 2025. 
§9609. De-identified and pseudonymous data 
1. De-identified data requirements. A controller in possession of de-identified data 
shall: 
A. Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an 
individual; 
B. Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to 
re-identify the data; and 
C. Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all 
provisions of this chapter. 
2. De-identified data and pseudonymous re-identification of data. Nothing in this 
chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to: 
A. Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or 
B. Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or 
technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request 
with personal data. 
3. Consumer requests. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a 
controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the 
controller: 
A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it 
would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the 
personal data; 
B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the 
subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data 
about the same consumer; and • 
C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the 
personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in 
this section. 
4. Pseudonymous data requirements. The rights afforded under section 9604, 
subsection 1 do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases when the controller is able to 
demonstrate that information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is 
subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from 
accessing the information.

identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual 
commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall 
take appropriate steps to address breaches of those contractual commitments. 
§9610. Geofence 
A person may not use a geofence to establish a virtual perimeter within 1,750 feet of 
any facility that provides in-person health care services for the purpose of identifying,

consumer whose personal data is being processed; and 
(2) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations 
under federal or state laws or local ordinances. 
2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this

internal use to: 
A. Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or

B. Effectuate a product recall; 
C. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality;

performance of a contract to which the consumer is a patty, 
3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under 
this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor

this State as patt of a privileged communication. 
4. Liability. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a 3rd-patty

processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have 
actual knowledge that the receiving 3rd-patty processor or 3rd-patty controller would 
violate this chapter. A 3rd-patty controller or 3rd-patty processor receiving personal data 
from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation 
of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party 
controller or 3rd-patty processor receives the personal data.

SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
enacts the Maine Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect July 1, 2025. The Act regulates 
the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of nonpublicly available 
personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual who is a resident of the 
State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer, 11 by a person that conducts business in this 
State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred to in 
the Act as a "controller. 11 Under the Act, a controller must limit the collection of personal 
data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for 
which the controller processes that data, as disclosed in a privacy notice specifying the 
categories of personal data processed by the controller, the purposes for processing the': 
personal data, the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties and the categories 
of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The Act also requires a controller to process 
the minimum amount of personal data reasonably necessary, adequate or relevant for each 
disclosed processing purpose. 
A consumer has the right, under the Act, to confirm whether a controller is processing 
the consumer's personal data; to require the controller to correct inaccuracies in or delete 
the consumer's personal data; to obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data; and to opt 
out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, 
sale or profiling in furtherance of decisions about the consumer's access to financial or 
lending services, housing, insurance, education, criminal justice, employment 
opportunities, health care services and essential goods and services. The privacy notice 
must describe how a consumer may exercise these rights. The controller must obtain the 
affirmative, informed consent of a consumer before processing the consumer's sensitive 
data, including data revealing the consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, 
mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual orientation, citizenship or 
immigration status; genetic or biometric data; precise geolocation data; complete social 
security, driver's license or nondriver identification card number; specific financial or 
account access information; data of a known child who has not attained 13 years of age; or 
data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime. If the controller knows that 
the consumer has not attained 13 years of age, the controller may not process the consumer's 
data for any purpose without parental consent. If the controller knows or willfully 
disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of age, 
the controller may not process the consumer's data for targeted advertising and must obtain 
the consumer's consent before processing the consumer's data for sale. 
The Act prohibits a controller from processing data in a manner that discriminates 
against a person in violation of state or federal law. A controller is also prohibited from 
retaliating against a consumer for exercising the consumer's rights under the Act, except

that a controller may offer different prices or selection of goods in connection with a 
consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty or discount program. A controller 
must establish, implement and maintain reasonable data security practices and a retention 
schedule that requires the deletion or de-identification of personal data when retention of 
the data is no longer reasonably necessary and relevant to the purposes for which data is 
processed or when deletion of the data is required by law. Beginning July 1, 2025, if a 
controller engages in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a 
consumer, including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or profiling or any 
processing of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a data protection 
assessment to identify and weigh the benefits and potential risks of the processing activity. 
The controller may be required to disclose the data protection assessment to the Attorney 
General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is relevant to an investigation 
conducted by the Attorney General. The Act further prohibits any person from establishing 
a geofence within 1,750 feet of any in-person health care facility in the State, other than 
the operator of the facility, for the purpose of identifying, tracking, collecting data from or 
sending a notification regarding consumer health data to consumers who enter that area. 
The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including 
the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the 
State; financial institutions or their affiliates subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act that are directly and solely engaged in financial activities; state-licensed and authorized 
insurers that are in compliance with applicable Maine laws governing insurer data security 
and data privacy; broadband Internet access service providers subject to the data privacy 
requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 9301; and persons that 
both processed the personal data of fewer than 25,000 consumers in the preceding calendar 
year and derived no more than 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data. The 
Act also does not apply to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for 
purposes other than completing payment transactions of fewer than 100,000 consumers in 
the preceding calendar year, except that, beginning January 1, 2027, this exception applies 
only to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than 
completing payment transactions off ewer than 50,000 consumers in the preceding calendar 
year. 
In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated types of 
data, including: nonpublic personal information regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach­
Bliley Act; protected health information under the federal Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996; personal data regulated by the Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and maintained by the controller regarding an 
applicant for employment or employee to the extent the data is collected and used within 
the context of that role; and data necessary for the controller to administer benefits. The 
Maine Consumer Privacy Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in 
specifically enumerated activities, including complying with Maine or federal law; 
complying with investigations or subpoenas from governmental authorities including the 
Federal Government and the government of the State or a federally recognized Indian tribe 
in the State; cooperating with federal, Maine or tribal law enforcement agencies; providing 
a product or service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical 
safety of consumers and preventing or responding to security incidents; and conducting 
internal product research, effectuating a product recall or performing other internal 
operations aligned with the expectations of a consumer.
