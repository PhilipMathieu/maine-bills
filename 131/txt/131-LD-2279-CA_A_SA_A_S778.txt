29 commits a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $1,000 may be adjudged and 
30 that any violation constitutes prima facie evidence of a violation of the Maine Unfair Trade 
31 Practices Act.

34 provide names, addresses and electronic mail addresses of the landowners owning less than 
• 35 1,000 acres of forest land statewide upon request to a nonprofit corporation that provides
