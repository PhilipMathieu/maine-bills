SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and makes the following changes to the laws 
governing the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board. 
1. It adds the executive director of the Maine Health Data Organization as an ex officio 
nonvoting member. 
2. It removes the authority of the board to recommend that public payors pay an 
assessment to supp01t the administration of the board. 
3. It changes the scope of the duties of the board to focus on an assessment of strategies 
to reduce prescription drug costs, reduce the rate of growth in prescription drug spending 
and reduce cost batTiers for consumers. 
4. It requires the board to review in its next annual repo1t how states with authority to 
establish upper payment limits have implemented that authority, to recommend whether 
the board should have comparable authority and to include an estimate of savings to the 
State if the State applies reference-based pricing to the first 10 prescription drugs for which 
the Medicare program has negotiated maximum fair prices through the Medicare drug price 
negotiation program. 
The amendment also authorizes the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board to 
set upper payment limits to be paid by public and private payors in the State for prescription 
drugs. The amendment requires the board to adopt, no later than January 1, 2026, rules 
establishing a methodology for setting upper payment limits and designates those rules as 
major substantive rules, which require approval of the Legislature before being finally 
adopted. The methodology adopted by the board must take into consideration certain 
minimum criteria, including the cost of the prescription drug; whether the Medicare

the prescription drug in the State. The amendment requires the board to dete1mine an 
effective date for an upper payment limit set by the board and to publish on its publicly 
accessible website a list of prescription drugs for which it has set an upper payment limit.
