Fiscal Detail and Notes
The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has indicated that additional resources are required to complete the initial
review required by this bill. The bill includes a one-time Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $102,100 in fiscal
year 2024-25 for contract consulting services and other associated costs. Since the PUC is funded by assessments on
transmission and distribution utilities set to produce sufficient revenue for any expenditures needed to operate, the
assessments will be increased to fund the new allocations,
Any additional costs to the Efficiency Maine Trust to implement the provisions of this bill are expected to be minor
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
