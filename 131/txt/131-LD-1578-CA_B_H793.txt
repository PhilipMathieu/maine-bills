34 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "B" to H.P. 1023, L.D. 1578 
"Do you favor adopting the Interstate Compact: Agreement Among the 
States to Elect the President of the United States by National Popular Vote, 
under which all of a participating state's electoral votes are awarded to the 
presidential slate that receives the most popular votes· in all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia, except that the compact takes effect only when 
the number of electoral votes held by the participating states equals a 
majority of the overall total number of electoral votes, which is at least 270 
of the 538 total electoral votes?" 
The legal voters of each city, town and plantation shall vote by ballot on this question 
and designate their choice by a cross or check mark placed within a corresponding square 
below the word "Yes" or "No." The ballots must be received, sorted, counted and declared 
in open ward, town and plantation meetings and returns made to the Secretary of State in 
the same manner as votes for members of the Legislature. The Governor shall review the 
returns. If a majority of the legal votes are cast in favor of this Act, the Governor shall 
proclaim the result without delay and this Act becomes effective 30 days after the date of 
the proclamation. 
The Secretary of State shall prepare and furnish to each city, town and plantation all 
ballots, returns and copies of this Act necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
referendum.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes provisions of the bill related to batch elimination, which 
were repealed in Public Law 2023, chapter 304, and makes an additional technical 
correction. It also removes the provision of the bill requiring the Governor to send a 
separate certificate of determination of the electors containing the names of the electors to 
the Archivist of the United States under state seal and instead requires only the one 
certificate of determination, which must contain the names of the electors and the statewide 
number of votes for each presidential slate that received votes in the final round of the 
presidential vote counting process, to be sent. The amendment also adds a referendum 
provision in order to send this Act to the voters of the State for acceptance or rejection at a 
statewide election held in the month of November following the passage of this Act.
