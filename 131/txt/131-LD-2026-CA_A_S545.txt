Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill authorizes the Department of Marine Resources to issue a menhaden fishing license to individuals who did
not meet the eligibility criteria because a medical issue prevented them from fishing during the qualifying years. Due
to the limited number of potential licensees who might qualify, any additional license revenue from the medical
waivers is not anticipated to be significant.
