Fitness to serve\n28\nThe commission shall find a transmission and distribution utility with 50,000 or more \n29\ncustomers unfit to serve and shall require and ensure the sale of the utility, to be completed \n30\nwithin 24 months, if 4 or more of the following statements are true of the utility:\n31\n1.  Customer satisfaction.  The utility has been rated for 2 or more of the past 5 years \n32\namong the lowest decile of utilities of a similar size for customer satisfaction on a nationally \n33\nrecognized survey of United States utility business or residential customers;\n34\n2.  Reliability.  The utility has been found by the commission or by the United States \n35\nEnergy Information Administration for 2 or more of the past 5 years to have overall \n36\nreliability in terms of outage minutes per year, with or without major event days, in the \n37\nlowest decile of utilities of a similar size in the country;\n38\n3.  Affordability.  In 2 or more of the past 5 years, the utility charged residential \n39\ndelivery rates reasonably estimated to be in the highest decile among utilities of a similar \n40\nsize in the country, based on data from the United States Energy Information \n4\n5\n6\n7\n41\nAdministration and based on the commission's analysis of average delivery rates as a \n42\nproportion of the average total bill for integrated utilities;\n3\n4.  Employees.

The utility owns critical infrastructure vital to the security and welfare of \n7\nthe State and is presently owned, either wholly or in a part greater than 5%, by a government \n8\nthat does not represent or govern the captive customers of the utility;\n9\n6.  Customer obligations.  The utility, due to its corporate structure, requires that \n10\ncustomers pay for the cost of the utility's corporate taxes, and also pay for shareholder \n11\nprofits exceeding 10% on prudent capital investment in transmission infrastructure, with \n12\nlittle to no risk for poor performance;\n13\n7.  Disaster assistance.  The utility, due to its corporate structure, may require that \n14\ncustomers pay directly or indirectly for 90% or more of damages to the utility's assets \n15\ncaused by extreme weather events, and may also deny the utility access to federal \n16\nemergency management assistance to reduce or eliminate these costs; or\n17\n8.  Priorities.  The utility, due to its corporate structure and fiduciary obligations, is \n18\nunable to place the needs of customers, workers or the State's climate and connectivity \n19\ngoals ahead of the desires of shareholders to earn a profit.\n20\nSec. 7.  35-A MRSA \u00a73501, sub-\u00a71, \u00b6D, as amended by PL 2019, c. 311, \u00a72, is \n21\nfurther amended to read:\n22\nD.

A, \u00a786 \n31\nand affected by \u00a7\u00a7104 and 105, is further amended to read:\n32\nNotwithstanding section 310, any consumer-owned transmission and distribution \n33\nutility, except for the Pine Tree Power Company established in chapter 40, that proposes \n34\nto increase rates, tolls or charges by not more than 15% of the utility's annual operating \n35\nrevenues or proposes to decrease rates, tolls or charges in any amount may elect to set rates \n36\npursuant to this section and section 3503.\n37\nSec. 11.  35-A MRSA \u00a73506 is enacted to read:\n38\n\u00a73506.

The board is \n8\nsubject to freedom of access laws and to laws preventing conflicts of interest.\n9\nThe initiated bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission beginning January 1, \n10\n2025 to find a transmission and distribution utility unfit to serve and to direct the sale of \n11\nthe utility if the utility meets certain criteria.",
